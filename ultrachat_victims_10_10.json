    "We know you\u2019ve done some pretty awesome stuff over the past four years. Please get creative when you\u2019re writing about those things. Honestly, when you start tackling the college essays, you should spend most of your time planning out what you\u2019re going to write about.\nHere\u2019s a list of yawn-worthy college essays we are just tired of reading.\nThe essay about your mission trip to Guatemala when you realized that there was poverty in the world. We\u2019ve read this one at least 3 billion times. If you\u2019re going to talk about your mission trip, pleeeeaseeee have a better life lesson at the end.\nThe essay about how your grandma came to the US from El Salvador or wherever and pulled herself up by her bootstraps. You have a cool grandma; that is awesome. But she\u2019s not applying to college. Your essay needs to be about you.\nThe essay about how you went to the championships with your basketball team, and you learned that \u201chard work pays off\u201d. Cool. Now let\u2019s go about 8 zillion times deeper. You need to put a lot of thought into the \u201cwhat you learned\u201d part of the college essay. This is your chance to show maturity and perspective. Use it!\nThe essay about how you\u2019ve always wanted to be a lawyer because that\u2019s what your parents do. Show the admissions people you\u2019ve grown up a bit. This sentiment is fine to have, as long as you back it up with the ways you\u2019ve explored that career path on your own.\nThe essay about how you got injured playing sports and had to sit on the bench for a season, which taught you to appreciate your health. Unless you have had to endure a serious medical condition, steer clear of injury essays. A story about a broken arm and being benched for a season is a total snooze. Can you summarize the list of common essay topics that college admissions officers are tired of reading about?",

    "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen President Trump in the \u201cSanctions are Coming\u201d meme directed toward Iran.\nMaybe Trump just thought it was cool-looking, or maybe he really is a Game of Thrones fan who imagines himself in combat on the Wall. Or maybe it was just a lower-level staffer on his account who thought it was cool. But regardless, it shows that there\u2019s at least some purchase for this kind of heroic-fiction narrative in the White House, shaping how they want the public to think of them and quite possibly how the president thinks about himself.\nOh come on! Try a bit harder. This has nothing to do with what the cast of Game of Thrones thinks.\nIn a statement released by the White House later Friday, Trump said: \u201cOn Monday, November 5, the termination of United States participation in the Iran nuclear deal will be complete. The last set of sanctions lifted under the terrible nuclear deal will come back into force, including powerful sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors, and sanctions targeting transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and sanctioned Iranian banks.\nI have a feeling that some executive finally figured out the President Trump, personally and totally for free, gave them the finest advertising any TV show has ever received! Today the entire country is talking about Game of Thrones. I can\u2019t even imagine what that kind of advertising is worth!\nYou guys get a ANNOYING BUZZER SOUND HERE for literally looking a gift horse in the mouth!\nActivists like Amy Schumer have used the phrase \u201cNovember Is Coming\u201d in the wake of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and a jacket featuring the phrase even sold out. But they don\u2019t use the phrase in quite the same manner as Trump did.\nTrump\u2019s administration has used movie marketing tactics in its messaging, and even used an blockbuster-style trailer in Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim Jong Un. Trump said he played it for the North Korean leader.\nWell, close but no cigar but at least they\u2019re awake enough to realize we\u2019ve seen something like this before.\nAll right . . . I guess it\u2019s my job to point out what should be obvious to everyone. Donald Trump is using the \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d strategy to see if he can get Iran to communicate with him. He\u2019s asking them to meme back or tweet something that he can use to start a dialog. He\u2019s put something so outrageous and over the top out there that the leadership of Iran has certainly seen it and probably has analysts working overtime trying to figure out what it means.\nNote to Iran: It just means he\u2019d like to engage with you and humor is always a good way to start a conversation.\nHe\u2019s right here \u2014 listening. You don\u2019t have to go through any kind of channels. If you want to say something, just say it and we\u2019ll see whether we can talk with one another.\nGood grief. Now was that so hard to understand? Based on the passage above, Could you continue the article's discussion on how the Trump administration has used movie marketing tactics in its messaging?",

    "Is there any information provided in the article about the cost of rail access from Miami to the port and who would be funding it?\nGenerate according to: A Miami-Dade County transportation board last week agreed to review the movement of Port of Miami freight by rail although a key proponent says port officials are skeptical.\nWhen the Metropolitan Planning Organization Governing Board met Thursday, members considered solutions to a funding shortfall for a planned $1 billion-plus port tunnel.\nHighlighting deficiencies with the county\u2019s road network, Miami City Commissioner Johnny Winton suggested a modification to a resolution to incorporate a review of movement of port freight by rail.\n\"The port tunnel is going to pop up on Watson Island, jump off (State Road) 836 and go right by the $450 million Miami Performing Arts Center and a tremendous number of new condos,\" said Mr. Winton, \"and all the cargo traffic is going to go right through there.\"\nA feasibility study is expected to be ready by the end of the year. Mr. Winton said that is only part of the solution \u2013 the method of transporting goods through the tunnel is its complement.\n\"My concern is that once the cargo containers go over the river, they\u2019re going to get half a mile down the road and in 15 or 20 years, they\u2019re not going to go anywhere,\" he said, \"because the cargo all has to go to west Miami-Dade because 836 is a mess and it\u2019s going to be worse.\"\nViability of transporting freight by rail, he said, was discussed Oct. 17 at the port.\n\"There are significant forces opposed to this analysis, and they\u2019re principally coming from the port,\" Mr. Winton said. \"They don\u2019t want this analysis done. They\u2019re already convinced it doesn\u2019t work. They told me.\"\nMeanwhile, he said, officials at Florida East Coast Industries, which owns rights of way that are part of the project, has been cooperative, he said.\n\"I\u2019ve had extensive discussions with President Adolfo Henriques and others from Florida East Coast Industries,\" Mr. Winton said. \"The suggestion is that we look at a feasibility analysis to determine the impact of moving as much cargo as we can off the port by rail. We\u2019d have to put the rail line in a tunnel or open trench.\n\"I don\u2019t know what the appropriate vehicle is, and nobody else does right now. It would go (north) to 72nd Street and then go due west.\"\nThe original resolution before the governing board directed staff to develop a plan to finance the unfunded portion project and to identify additional improvements to help fill needs of the port \u2013 including rail access and other improvements.\nMr. Winton suggested and the board accepted a modification that added an obligation to commission an independent, objective study funded by the organization on the viability and cost of rail access from Miami to the port by surface or tunnel.",
