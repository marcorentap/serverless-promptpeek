    "What many companies do when planning their global marketing strategies is to organize the world\u2019s countries into three categories.\nEmerging Markets \u2013 Markets regarded as having the most potential for growth (e.g. huge countries such as China and India) and targeted for long-term investment.\nRest of the World (ROW) Markets \u2013 Markets that are often not included in a global marketing strategy because a company does not have sufficient time or resources to pay them any attention.\nA typical company involved in global marketing is likely to have four or five core markets and maybe six to twelve emerging markets.\nIs it Wise to Ignore the ROW?\nCollectively the ROW consists of a huge market of over a billion people. Of course the ROW includes a lot of small countries, but even a country with only five to six million people (e.g. Denmark and Ireland) could be very profitable for the right product. Click here for a list of countries in order of population.\nWhich Languages Does the \u201cRest of the World\u201d Speak?\nThe Web Globalization Report Card, which tracks the websites of 150 global companies, reports a steadily increasing number of languages supported by global content. As of 2018, the average number of languages supported by all 150 global websites is now thirty-two.\nThe success of global marketing can only be achieved through the use of local languages. If the growth in the number of languages is imagined as a curve, this curve begins quite steeply as companies load up on the core European and Asian languages. After a company reaches the level of twenty languages, the curve starts to taper off. The number of languages supported by a few companies, such as Facebook, Visa, and Dyson has shot up in sudden spikes. However, most companies are only in the early stages of this growth curve.\nIt would be a herculean task to utilize the more than 6,000 languages spoken worldwide, so a global marketing company has to narrow down its language choices to the languages spoken by its core target audiences. The following is a list of ten languages that are shared by leading global websites.\nEnglish \u2013 English is the language of globalization and is spoken by over 75% of the world\u2019s population.\nChinese (Simplified) \u2013 If people in Chinese speaking markets continue to expand their internet usage, Chinese might one day supplant English as the most widely used internet language.\nArabic \u2013 The Arabic language is spoken by 295 million speakers worldwide, and is the official language of 28 different countries. A report from the British Council ranks Arabic as the second most important language of the future.\nSpanish \u2013 There are a number of important Spanish speaking countries, not to mention that the Hispanic population in the US will likely double by 2050.\nGerman \u2013 The German language is the fourth most spoken language in the world with nearly 210 million speakers worldwide.\nPortuguese \u2013 Second behind Spanish in Latin America. Portuguese is spoken by 215 million people in Portugal, Brazil, and some parts of Africa.\nFrench \u2013 French is the official language of over 29 countries throughout the world including several of the fastest growing African economies.\nJapanese \u2013 Japanese has 130 million native speakers and a similar number of non-native speakers spread out over the world.\nRussian \u2013 There are 160 million native speakers in Russia and throughout central and Eastern Europe.\nHindi \u2013 Although India is home to 126 million English speakers, around 85% of the population doesn\u2019t speak English well or at all. India represents an enormous growing market.\nIf you are hoping to increase your global marketing reach, it\u2019s essential to expand the number of languages your website or app supports. All countries, including the \u201crest of the world,\u201d are within your reach. Once you have decided on your target markets, Localize will help you translate your content into the local languages. Talk to us for more information.\nCan you provide a list of the top ten languages that global marketing companies should focus on, according to the leading global websites?",

    "Can you summarize the different types of thalassemia and how they affect the body?: Thalassemia is a blood disorder that causes mild or severe anemia (Antonio, 1993). This happens when people do not have enough hemoglobin and is caused by the inheritance of a defective gene (Nathan, 1998). Thalassemia is passed on from a parent to children through their genes (Simon, 1999). The name thalassemia comes from the Greek word \"thalassa\" meaning \"the sea\" because the condition was first described in populations living near the Mediterranean Sea (Nathan, 1998). However, the disease is also prevalent in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and pacific descent (Simon, 1999). Moreover, thalassemia causes an immense disruption in the hemoglobin synthesis (Nathan, 1998). Although, there are two different types of thalassemia, alpha, and beta thalassemia they both affect the body.\nAlpha-thalassemia occurs most commonly in people from Southeast Asia and China (Ghosh, 1994). Its is caused when the hemoglobin does not produce enough alpha protein (Ghosh, 1994). The most severe form of alpha thalassemia causes (stillbirth, and death of fetus before delivery) (Ghosh, 1994).\nWhereas, beta thalassemia, is caused by a mutation in the beta globin chain (Nathan, 1998). Genes from both parents must be inherited to acquire the major form of this disease (Simon, 1999). In beta thalassemia major children are normal at birth, but develop anemia during the first year of life (Simon, 1999). The alpha and beta thalassemia's are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Therefore, the symptoms of thalassemia, which are paleness, tiredness, dark urine, and spleen enlargement all, depend on the type and severity of the disease ( Simon, 1999).\nWriteWork contributors. \"Thalassemia\" WriteWork.com.

    "Southern Cone Travel: Ice, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nIce, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nAlmost everyone who visits Patagonia looks forward to seeing the great glaciers of Chile\u2019s Fuegian fjords or the massive southern icefields that culminate in Argentina\u2019s Moreno Glacier (pictured below). There are other cool treats that await visitors, though - on their palates, in the form of ice cream (or gelato, if you prefer). Some of it is found in Patagonia itself, but it\u2019s also popular in gateway cities like Buenos Aires.\nMost but not all of those treats are from Argentina, stemming from the Italian tradition that has spread throughout the country. I\u2019d like to recommend a sample of ice creameries and flavors, though I\u2019ll acknowledge a personal prejudice at the beginning: I do not share the adoration for dulce de leche, made from caramelized milk (which Chileans call manjar) that all Argentines and many Chileans drool over. Personally, I find it sickly sweet and, if you choose to try it, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I will not mention it further.\nFor more than three decades, my personal favorite has been Cadore (pictured above) in the Congreso district of downtown Buenos Aires (one of the gateway cities for many a Patagonia itinerary). In the same family since it opened in the 1950s. it\u2019s won awards in Italy itself. The roster of flavors may be less diverse than some more contemporary helader\u00edas, but the quality is extraordinary. My recommendations: chocolate amargo (bittersweet chocolate) and mousse de lim\u00f3n (lemon mousse) are an unbeatable combination.\nIn northern Argentine Patagonia, at the base of the Andes, the town of El Bols\u00f3n is the cradle of Helados Jauja (pictured above), which produces many standard flavors but specializes in local fruit flavors, among them the wild calafate berry (according to legend, whoever eats the berry will come back to Patagonia for more). In recent years, this one-of-a-kind ice creamery has opened branches in Buenos Aires and elsewhere, but still produces everything at its home base. My recommendation: calafate con leche de oveja (calafate berries with sheep\u2019s milk) and mate cocido con tres de az\u00facar (Argentines\u2019 favorite infusion, roughly comparable to green tea, is also popular in parts of Chile).\nMeanwhile, in the Chilean ferry port of Puerto Natales \u2013 the gateway to Torres del Paine \u2013 Mesita Grande (pictured above) is a pizzeria that takes its name from the single long table that its diners necessarily share. That said, it prepares its own ice cream and, when I offhandedly mentioned Jauja\u2019s calafate flavor, Mesita\u2019s Argentine manager went out of her way to track down berries and sheep\u2019s milk to try to duplicate it. A couple days later, she phoned me to come try it, and the result was a promising experiment that\u2019s not on the regular menu. Still, in its absence, here are my recommendations: chocolate and ruibarbo (rhubarb). There\u2019s also a branch in Punta Arenas, the gateway to the glacial fjords of Tierra del Fuego (pictured below). What is Helados Jauja specializing in and what are some recommended flavors to try at this ice creamery in El Bols\u00f3n?",

    "What are the potential obstacles to adopting the Phonebloks concept, including economic and aesthetic factors? Answer according to: We all know that the cycle of electronics consumerism is broken. Because it's an endless money drain for consumers to keep their gadgets current. Because the never ending desire to show off new features leads to bloat and complexity of design. And because all our outdated, abandoned gadgets have to go somewhere. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we Americans threw away 310 million electronic gadgets in 2010 alone. That's about 1.8 million tons of toxic, nonbiodegradable waste in our landfills.\nAt least somebody's expressing concern about this problem\u2014nearly 15 million somebodies, actually. That's how many people have watched a viral YouTube video called Phonebloks, which touts a new phone concept by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens.\nHakkens wants the people of Earth to rise up and demand a new kind of cell phone, in which the various components\u2014camera, processor, GPS, screen\u2014snap together like Legos.\nThis system, he says, would let you build exactly the phone you want. If you keep your files online, you could remove the storage module and replace it with a bigger battery. If you are older, you could unplug the camera and replace it with a bigger speaker.\nAbove all, though, he suggests that the Phonebloks concept would dramatically cut down on e-waste. You wouldn't throw away a phone every other year; instead you'd own just one phone that's built\u2014and rebuilt\u2014to last. If one component broke or became obsolete, you'd just unplug it and replace it with a new one.\nClearly, this concept is consumer catnip. It offers the promise of staying current\u2014without the guilt. And of saving us money and of making it easy for anyone to build a customized phone.\nThere's only one hitch: Phonebloks will never happen.\nThe first problem: physics. Today's smartphone is a miracle of miniaturization. To keep the size small, the speed up and the battery life long, the components are packed in as closely as possible. In Apple's iPhone, for example, the memory, the processor and the graphics circuitry are all built into a single chip. A Phonebloks phone would introduce relatively gigantic distances between these elements, which would kill the battery life, speed and size.\nWhich brings us to the second problem: bulk. Steve Jobs refused to put a removable battery on the iPhone for this reason. A removable battery has to be enclosed in rigid walls so that you, the human, can handle it safely. If every component of your phone were a self-contained, sealed box like that battery, you'd have one very boxy, very bulky, very heavy phone.\nThe third problem: given the limited real estate, today's smartphone engineers sweat over component placement. Where should the antennas go for the best reception? Where does the speaker go for best audio? With free placement of any block on a Phonebloks phone, you would lose enormous advantages of quality, convenience and speed.\nThe fourth problem: economics. The Verizons and AT&Ts of the world love that we throw away our phones every other year; indeed, locking us into new two-year contracts is their business model. Why would they support any movement that would disrupt their herd of cash cows?\nAnd finally: aesthetics. Who would buy the big, boxy, gray, sharp-cornered prototype illustrated in the video?\nYou want to love the Phonebloks concept. You'd love to have more control, greater savings and less guilt. Unfortunately, you'd pay quite a penalty: your phone would be big, heavy, slow, hot, fragile and ugly. Some analysts have even asserted that we would wind up with more electronic waste, a result of consumers discarding more modules more frequently.\nThere is some good news on the discarded-phone front: from all indications, the smartphone is maturing. The improvements in each year's new models are getting less dramatic. These days it's primarily the software that distinguishes your iPhone from your Samsung\u2014and software leaves nothing in landfills.\nEven so, e-waste and obsolescence remain distressing problems. No, Phonebloks is not the solution. But at least it has drawn attention to our current system\u2014and just how broken it is.\nDavid Pogue is the personal-technology columnist for the New York Times and an Emmy Award-winning correspondent for CBS News.",

Or maybe it was just a lower-level staffer on his account who thought it was cool. But regardless, it shows that there\u2019s at least some purchase for this kind of heroic-fiction narrative in the White House, shaping how they want the public to think of them and quite possibly how the president thinks about himself.\nOh come on! Try a bit harder. This has nothing to do with what the cast of Game of Thrones thinks.\nIn a statement released by the White House later Friday, Trump said: \u201cOn Monday, November 5, the termination of United States participation in the Iran nuclear deal will be complete. The last set of sanctions lifted under the terrible nuclear deal will come back into force, including powerful sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors, and sanctions targeting transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and sanctioned Iranian banks.\nI have a feeling that some executive finally figured out the President Trump, personally and totally for free, gave them the finest advertising any TV show has ever received!

But they don\u2019t use the phrase in quite the same manner as Trump did.\nTrump\u2019s administration has used movie marketing tactics in its messaging, and even used an blockbuster-style trailer in Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim Jong Un. Trump said he played it for the North Korean leader.\nWell, close but no cigar but at least they\u2019re awake enough to realize we\u2019ve seen something like this before.\nAll right . . . I guess it\u2019s my job to point out what should be obvious to everyone. Donald Trump is using the \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d strategy to see if he can get Iran to communicate with him. He\u2019s asking them to meme back or tweet something that he can use to start a dialog. He\u2019s put something so outrageous and over the top out there that the leadership of Iran has certainly seen it and probably has analysts working overtime trying to figure out what it means.\nNote to Iran: It just means he\u2019d like to engage with you and humor is always a good way to start a conversation.\nHe\u2019s right here \u2014 listening.

Mr. Winton said that is only part of the solution \u2013 the method of transporting goods through the tunnel is its complement.\n\"My concern is that once the cargo containers go over the river, they\u2019re going to get half a mile down the road and in 15 or 20 years, they\u2019re not going to go anywhere,\" he said, \"because the cargo all has to go to west Miami-Dade because 836 is a mess and it\u2019s going to be worse.\"\nViability of transporting freight by rail, he said, was discussed Oct. 17 at the port.\n\"There are significant forces opposed to this analysis, and they\u2019re principally coming from the port,\" Mr. Winton said. \"They don\u2019t want this analysis done.

    "Can you summarize the history and development of the Dumfries and Galloway Carers Centre?\nGenerate according to: The Dumfries and Galloway Carers Centre was established in 1996 following a lot of hard work by a group of Carers and those interested in creating a support organisation for Carers in Dumfries and Galloway. This group became the initial Management Board for the new service. Funded by the local Council, local NHS and funds secured by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers nationally the first two members of staff (including the now Manager, Claudine Brindle) set out to develop the service for, and with, Carers. Work started in a tiny office in Great King Street and then the first Carers Centre on Bank Street opened its doors in February 1997 with the HRH Princess Royal's official opening a year later.\nOver the first five years the organisation worked locally with Carers to provide information, advice and support. The team increased to six staff based throughout Dumfries and Galloway. In response to the first National Strategy for Carers in 1999 and the subsequent Scottish Strategy for Carers in 2000, the Carers Centre worked with local commissioners to include Carers views in the development of the first ever Dumfries and Galloway Carers Strategy. This was launched in 2001 and as a result extra funding was obtained to allow further services to be developed, namely: the Hospital Carers support service; the Young Carers Project; and the Carers Training Project. As a result the staff team quickly doubled.\nIn 2005 the Carers Centre moved to larger premises in Nith Street to offer improved services to Carers - training, groups and wellbeing activities could now be offered on site. This offered Carers access to staff at the same time as attending events. A dedicated Young Carers space was also created ensuring the children and young people had a place to meet.\nAgain the Centre has assisted in the recently launched new Carers Strategy which will see new and existing services developed in response to the needs of Carers locally. Over 7000 individual Carers have registered since inception with an average of 450 new Carers registering each year. All are provided with a quality service that aims to improve the outcomes for Carers living in Dumfries and Galloway.",

    "As I\u2019ve said again and again \u2013 Science is everywhere! It\u2019s in the air we breathe, the body we move around in, the nature around us, and the food we eat. It\u2019s even in the sweet treats we enjoy. Yes, Peeps science is a thing. One of our kids\u2019 (and maybe my) favorite things to do with Peeps candy at Easter is put them in the microwave and watch them expand. If you remove them from the microwave before they explode or catch fire, (note: Remove the Peeps before this happens. This can ruin your microwave.) the puffy Peep collapses into a flattened mass of goo. If you plan on eating it, do it fast before it cools and hardens. So what makes the Peep puff up in the microwave and then collapse as it cools? Peeps are made mostly of sugar, water, and gelatin. This mixture is heated and whipped to add air bubbles. This creates the light, fluffy texture of Peeps. As this mixture cools, the gelatin and air bubbles helps the Peeps hold their shape and not flatten. When we heat a Peep in the microwave, the air molecules in the bubbles inside the Peep start moving faster. As the molecules start moving faster, the pressure inside the bubbles begins to increase and push on the walls of the bubbles. The heat of the microwave is, also, starting to cause the sugar in the Peep to soften. So, when as the air molecules push on the sides of the bubbles inside the peep, the bubbles to expand and grow. This is what causes Peeps to get bigger when heated in the microwave. My kids are always disappointed when we take the puffed up Peep from the microwave only to see it instantly deflate. Once the heating stops, the air molecules slow down and stop pushing against the wall of the bubbles and some bubbles burst letting the air out of the Peep. This, plus the fact that some of the water in the Peep evaporates during heating lead to the collapse of the Peep. One day after looking at our deflated Peeps, we talked about the changes that took place in the Peeps do to heating. We thought about the air escaping and the water evaporating and wondered if this caused a change in mass, or weight. Well, there is only one way to find out. Design an experiment! Weigh your glass bowl. If your scale has a tare feature, use it now. If not, record the weight of the bowl. Next, add a Peep to the bowl and record the weight of the Peep. If you do not have a tare feature on your scale, you will have to subtract the weight of the bowl from the weight of the bowl and the Peep to find the weight of the Peep alone. Place the Peep and the bowl in the microwave. Heat for 30 seconds. Immediately after the microwave shuts off, take the bowl and Peep out of the microwave and weigh it. Record the weight of the Peep. Again, subtract the weight of the bowl if you did not use the tare feature. Continue this procedure with new Peeps each time increasing the time by 10 seconds until you have reached 60 seconds. Each time you repeat the experiment, it is called a trial. Record the before and after weights, along with the time for each trial. When all the trials are completed. Subtract the ending weights of each trial from the beginning weights. This is the mass or weight lost in each trial. Graph the amounts of weight lost against the time each Peep was heated. What does the graph look like? Discuss and explain your results. We always have way more peeps than we need to eat so this experiment will be a fun way to use up the extra peeps! Is it possible to do this in an oven? We don\u2019t have a microwave. That would be a great experiment \u2013 just to see if this works! Try it out and let me know how it goes. Can you explain why Peeps expand in the microwave and then collapse as they cool?",
    "How can insurance help keep your bike secure, especially with high rates of theft in the UK? Can you recommend any insurance providers?\nGenerate according to: Greener, leaner and once you make the initial investment it could save you a fortune in travelling costs \u2013 more and more of us are waking up to the life-changing benefits of cycling, whether it\u2019s for commuting, leisure or sport.\nCycling is on the rise, particularly as it\u2019s getting a little warmer. If it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in, it\u2019s time to start thinking about what you need to get the most out of your bike. Having taken up cycling properly over the last year or so, and trained to become a Breeze Champion with British Cycling, I hope I have learned enough to help you get into cycling too.\nThis may seem a little obvious, but there are still people out there who are cycling without a helmet! Study after study has shown that wearing a helmet reduces the risk of fatalities and injuries for all cyclists. Even minor falls can have potentially disastrous consequences if you hit your head. Remember, your brain is the only part of your body that can\u2019t repair itself, so be smart and protect it.\nKnowing how to do basic maintenance is a must for all cyclists. Nothing can ruin a ride faster than a flat tire, crooked stem, or a loose seatpost. Invest in some basic, quality tools, and maintenance becomes a whole lot easier.\nWe\u2019re all familiar with sunburn, but the sun can damage your eyes, too. It\u2019s also important that the sun doesn\u2019t restrict one\u2019s vision, especially if driving on road. For mountain bikers, there\u2019s also the danger of sticks, rocks and mud getting into your eye, which can cause more serious injuries. Most cycling sunglasses today are designed to protect your eyes with UV blocking treatments.\nWhen you ride you will burn a huge amount of calories. If you\u2019ll be riding more than 90 minutes, you should take snacks and water en route.\nA great pair of cycling shorts will be a life changing investment on your cycling journey. A good pair will include a chamois pad sewn in that offers plenty of cushion and support that will work with your saddle to keep you comfortable. The lycra material most shorts are made from also is highly breathable, wicks away sweat and is designed to minimize rubbing and chaffing.\nHaving spent hundreds on a bike and gear, have you thought about insurance? Sometimes locking up your bike just isn\u2019t enough. Last year approximately 448,000 bicycles were stolen in the UK, while research earlier this year shows that one bike is stolen every minute in the UK. That\u2019s pretty scary. If you\u2019d like to get a quote for insurance on your bike, you can cover it with your home contents with Urban Jungle \u2013 their quote journey only takes a few minutes from start to finish and will leave you feeling secure about your bike. With a unique contents calculator you can use to see what insurance would suit you best.\nA good jacket can help save your ride, especially in transitional seasons like spring. For the upcoming season you should go for a model that is windproof, water-resistant, and can pack up small enough to fit into a jersey pocket.\nChoosing the right cycling shoes is one of the most important decisions you can make. A bad fitting pair of shoes can turn what should have been a pleasant bike ride into hours of agony. The right pair of shoes aren\u2019t the ones that look the coolest, they\u2019re the ones that fit your feet the best.\nCycling gloves soak up that sweat, keeping your hands dry and allow you to maintain a safe grip on the handlebars at all times. Gloves can have padded palms, providing extra comfort by cushioning your hands from the vibrations passed through the bike and handlebar to the main contact points.\nIf you\u2019re considering cycling as a way to get fit for summer, use this list to make sure you stay safe and comfortable. If you have the essentials, you\u2019ll have no excuses!\nWell I needed this read, just about to get my bike out of the storage and haven\u2019t used it for last two years!\nI LOVE cycling ! Unfortunately my bike got stolen a few years back and I haven\u2019t had the money to buy a new one, let alone all the little extras you need in your kit.\nThese are great tips. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting a bike to get around London so this is really helpful!\nI haven\u2019t ridden a bike for so long, but these are some very useful tips!",

Thomas Oliveras both pleaded guilty Monday to disturbing the peace during a hearing in Orange County Superior Court as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. They each agreed to pay $500 to an emergency fund for crime victims but will not serve jail time or be placed on probation, according to court records.\nIn exchange for Hendricks\u2019 guilty plea, two counts of battery on emergency workers and a count of resisting arrest were dismissed. The former chief, who resigned from the police department two months after the concert incident, had faced up to three years in jail if found guilty of all charges.\nA single count of battery on an emergency worker and a count of resisting arrest were dismissed for Oliveras as part of the plea deal. Oliveras originally faced a maximum of two years in jail, if convicted as charged.\nBoth men can go through a legal process to get the convictions expunged at some point, defense attorney John Barnett said.\nThe men were off-duty and attending a Lady Antebellum concert in Irvine with their spouses on Aug. 24, 2018, when the chief\u2019s wife needed medical attention. When EMTs responded to assess her condition, authorities alleged at the time that Hendricks pushed two EMTs as they tried to provide treatment. Prosecutors said at the time that Oliveras put one victim in a headlock.\nIrvine police officers were called to the scene, and Hendricks and Oliveras were both accused of \u201cobstructing and delaying the investigation,\u201d prosecutors said.

Answer according to: It all started with a little problem\u2026.When my little 2 year old daughter was turning three, all she wanted was a beautiful sterling silver bracelet just like her mamas. So I thought this would be really easy to find. Oh, how little did I know!\nI searched for hours and days on end across shopping centres and boutiques to try and find a quality, affordable and trendy piece of kid's sterling silver, then looked online and couldn\u2019t find anything that was suitable for a small little girl, but came out empty-handed.\nThus began my journey to design and produce beautiful, luxurious sterling silver jewellery necklaces and bracelets, sized JUST for kids and tweens, and in a way that THEY can design, personalise and interchange their own designs. Also, I am very strict with the quality control, and create each piece so that it is durable and strong.\nAs a very practical Mother, (raising two little ones on my own), I wanted the children's jewellery to be high quality and affordable, but also grow with children. So, I made each piece fully adjustable to grow with children. I use lead free and nickel free premium .925 sterling silver and heavy 18 karat gold plating on our rose gold and yellow gold pieces, so the children's jewellery is built to last.\nWe hope your girls LOVE wearing the My Little Silver jewellery as much as i enjoyed designing them!",

    "What are some examples of subject lines used by retailers that effectively affirm the benefit of clicking and viewing the email? Answer according to: Facing criticism, Presidential campaigners employ better email marketing techniques, but their emails are still not what everyone wants to read. Just another email to skip over\u2013that\u2019s what Presidential campaign emails invoke in the minds of consumers and potential voters. And as the latest emails from Hilary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain will likely not be read, they can\u2019t be doing any good for democracy.\nWhile their recent actions have succeeded in improving the effectiveness of the sign-up process and email wording, campaigners have not fully tackled the motivational factor that is essential in successfully using email marketing services \u2013 a problem easily solved by examining techniques from the business community when constructing emails.\nWhat\u2019s in it for me? Obama and Hillary\u2019s most recent campaigns are ambiguous about this issue. The latest email message from Bill Clinton includes subject line: \u201cNot big on quitting.\u201d No subject is apparent in the line. Who is not big on quitting? Hillary? Bill? The email team? The supporters? Next, take the latest message from the Obama team: \u201cWhat\u2019s next.\u201d Again there is no subject, nor is there an action in this line. Open the email and find the first appeals to action; \u201ccontribute by our midnight Monday deadline\u201d and \u201ccheck out these resources\u201d by Bill Clinton and Obama, respectively.\nCompare Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s email marketing campaigns to that of an email marketing campaign from a market-leading retailer. Subject lines like \u201cTee Time: Buy 2 Save 20%\u201d and \u201cAll The Dresses You Need For Spring\u201d clearly affirm the benefit of clicking and viewing the email before email readers have seen any content. The first line employs two key verbs, \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201csave,\u201d while the second line directly accosts the reader. A simple revision of the subject lines with a seller-buyer framework could deliver: \u201cDeadline Ahead: Don\u2019t Quit, Act Now\u201d and \u201cEverything You Should Know about Obama.\u201d These subject lines create a sense of urgency and shift the locus of power from the sender to the recipients of the emails.\nFar from victorious on the subject lines front, Hillary\u2019s camp has made significant changes in the body of their emails. In an attempt to generate easy-to-read, visually arresting messages, they utilize bold font every few lines to highlight main ideas in the paragraphs. They also showcase a bold-colored countdown clock with a yellow \u201cContribute Now\u201d button link. Similarly, Obama\u2019s email highlights information by categorizing it under 3 headings (The Basics, Organizing, and Fundraising).\nLamentably, emails from both sides lack visuals. Obama and Hillary rarely include photos in their emails, and McCain includes just a few small photos in his email banner. In contrast, retailers, internet providers and pizza joints alike have been utilizing large picture links to attract consumers. The picture link is standard practice today. Democratic nominees recognize that they need to modify their marketing strategy, however, and have started using email marketing software to offer campaign contributors sweepstakes prizes, such as a private meeting with Obama or Clinton. Unfortunately, these offers can be hard to find. For example, Obama sent an email with the subject \u201cDeadline,\u201d but the email described a drawing to win a dinner with Barack Obama himself, which was listed towards the bottom of the email.\nObama\u2019s use of contribution incentives in his email marketing campaigns could explain why his email program ranks third on Email Data Source\u2019s 2008 Email Brand Equity Ranking while McCain, who does not use such tactics, is not among the top 5 of that list. Other reasons may include the perceived lack of exigency in the emails or the news-like headlines in McCain\u2019s subject lines.\nFour years ago, pundits, bloggers and the general public declared that the Presidential campaigns lagged far behind the business, technology, and entertainment sectors in internet marketing practices. In this election, Presidential hopefuls have succeeded in closing the gap in the email race, but have not yet achieved parity.",

    "Carl Sagan's thoughts on seeing our world as a \"pale blue dot\" set in the vastness of space might provide some perspective on the events of the past weeks. This excerpt was inspired by an image taken, at Sagan's suggestion, by Voyager 1 on February 14, 1990. As the spacecraft left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the solar system, engineers turned it around for one last look at its home planet. Voyager 1 was about 6.4 billion kilometers (4 billion miles) away, and approximately 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane, when it captured [a] portrait of our world. Caught in the center of scattered light rays (a result of taking the picture so close to the Sun), Earth appears as a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size.\nwhat reason is there \"to deal more kindly\" Based on the passage above, How might Carl Sagan's perspective on the fragility of our planet influence our actions and decisions as individuals and as a society?",
    "How long does it take for the vanilla extract to be ready to use?\nGenerate according to: Somehow vanilla has become synonymous with boring and bland. When, in fact, it is anything but. Vanilla is rich, exotic, fragrant, and quite expensive! It imparts a unique flavor and aroma into anything you add it to. I almost never bake without it. If you go through vanilla extract anywhere near the rate I do, I highly suggest trying your hand at making it yourself.\nPersonally, vanilla is my absolute favorite scent. I have several perfumes, lotions, and candles that all smell like vanilla. It\u2019s such a comforting and delicious smell. And I love using vanilla in the kitchen even more. Homemade vanilla extract adds a special touch to baked goods and desserts. I\u2019ll show you how to make vanilla extract so that you can have the best possible vanilla flavor for your treats!\nMaking vanilla extract is such a simple process! It requires two ingredients and a bottle with a tight-fitting lid. That\u2019s it! You have some choices in types of vanilla beans and alcohol. In the picture, I\u2019ve used Madagascar Bourbon vanilla beans on the left and Tahitian vanilla beans on the right. There are slight differences in flavor, scent, and size depending on the variety and quality. As for the alcohol, I prefer using vodka since it\u2019s neutral taste doesn\u2019t compete with the vanilla. No need to use an expensive brand here.\nI\u2019ve given quite a large range in the amount of vanilla beans because I\u2019ve found that they vary so much in size. Four large vanilla beans may be about equivalent to eight smaller vanilla beans. Use your judgement depending on the size of vanilla beans you have.\nWhen you use your homemade vanilla extract, you\u2019ll find that you get some of the little vanilla bean flecks along with it. I love the visual appeal, but feel free to strain them out if you prefer.\nThe process to make vanilla extract is really simple. Fill a glass jar or bottle with vodka. Split your vanilla beans, leaving them connected at the ends, if you\u2019d like. I often scrape out the vanilla beans inside to add to the vodka, but that step isn\u2019t necessary. Add your vanilla beans, close the lid tightly, and shake! Make sure to store it out of direct light or heat, and shake every day or two. That\u2019s it!\n2-ingredient DIY vanilla extract that is perfect for baking and adding a special vanilla flavor to so many recipes!\nSplit vanilla beans in half lengthwise with a sharp knife.\nAdd vanilla beans to a glass bottle or jar that has a tight-fitting lid.\nCover with vodka, close the lid tightly, and shake vigorously for a few seconds.\nStore the extract in a cool, dark place. Shake every day or two.\nAfter about 4-6 weeks, it's ready to use!\nLeave vanilla beans in the extract past the initial month or two to continue to infuse flavor. You may also remove them to use in another recipe, if desired.",

    "Given the text: It\u2019s always been true that you need your marketing to reach the right people. But today\u2019s digital marketing gives you an ability to structure personalised marketing campaigns that will make your prospects really feel your love \u2013 and be more inclined to become a customer, and even one of your champions.\nOver the past few years it has become a lot easier to find your customer through various channels online. Because of this, companies can interact with their target audience much more frequently and efficiently. Instead of the days of old when you might buy ad space in the newspaper or send out thousands of leaflets to random households, praying you would find leads, you can now narrow down your searches and pick out people to target.\nSearch for and follow people who are most likely to purchase your product. If you offer stationary supplies, try searching for businesses and schools.\nOver time companies are likely to follow back, which is when you can start attracting them to your brand.\nCreate a few blogs on why your product or service is important to businesses and how you are offering the best in the field; this will give them a reason to buy from you over your competitor.\nRemember, this method isn\u2019t instantaneous and your content needs time to spread. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep promoting it across social media.\nAnd finally, once you have built up a customer base, remember to keep them loyal. Send them quick updates on new products or retweet them every now and then. This is more likely to make them feel appreciated and therefore promote your brand as well.\nThe more your potential customer feels like they are valued by you, the more likely they are to actually want to help your business grow. It\u2019s about creating a reason for them to be loyal to you over your competition. It\u2019s very much like the snowball effect, the more customers are supportive of your brand, the more they will spread the word of your brand. This in turn attracts new customers who do the same.\nSo, in the future, tailor your content to specific individuals and keep them interested, giving them the opportunity to bring more customers to your business.\nWhat are some ways to build up a loyal customer base and retain them over time?",

Were there any significant changes observed in these measures after the program?\nGenerate according to: Citation: Hillier, A.J., Fish, T., Siegel, J.H., & Beversdorf, D.Q. (2011). Social and vocational skills training reduces self-reported anxiety and depression among young adults on the autism spectrum. The Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities, 23 (3), 267-276.\nAuthors: Hillier, A.J., Fish, T., Siegel, J.H., & Beversdorf, D.Q.\nBackground: People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently experience high levels of anxiety and depression. These psychological factors might be related to some of the core challenges seen among those with ASD, including social difficulties. Few previous studies have examined the broader outcomes for social skills interventions, such as a reduction in anxiety and depression, despite the prevalence of these comorbid conditions among those with ASD.\nPurpose: The purpose of paper is to report on a social and vocational skills program specifically designed to address the needs of adolescents and young adults with ASD.\nIntervention: Participants received the Aspirations program, which consisted of eight one-hour weekly meetings with small groups of between five to seven participants. The program was designed to improve social and vocational skills. During the program, participants sat in a semi-circle to facilitate discussion. Group members learned and gained greater understanding by sharing personal experiences and listening to those of others, by giving each other advice, and by creating problem solving strategies as a group.\nData collection and analysis: Participants were asked to complete questionnaires 2-3 weeks before and at the end of their participation in the Aspirations program. Questionnaires included a measure of depression which questioned participants\u2019 feelings of sadness, pessimism, guilt etc. Specific assessment used are: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory-II; Peer Relations Index. Data was analyzed non-parametrically due to the type of data (Wilcoxon signed ranks test), and hypotheses were two-tailed.\nFindings: The findings indicate that participants reported significantly reduced anxiety after their participation in the Aspirations program compared to before with lower scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Participants also reported significantly reduced depression after participating in our program compared to before with lower scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Responses on the Peer Relations Index (Hudson 1992) were higher post- Aspirations compared to pre-Aspirations indicating improvement in attitudes and feelings toward peers, although this did not reach significance.\nConclusions: To conclude, following the intervention program participants reported significantly lower depression and anxiety. Responses on a measure of peer relationships were also improved post-intervention, although this did not reach significance. Although preliminary, the findings demonstrate the broader, positive impact that such programs may have.",

    "What are the challenges facing mobile advertising, according to the author, and why does it make him worry about the future of advertising in this medium? Generate according to: Recently, I spent a few days on the West Coast visiting some VCs, tech companies that look like media companies, and startups. I spent an amazing day at Y Combinator\u2019s Demo Day, which is always a highlight and really inspiring. It\u2019s fantastic to watch people who truly believe they have a business that will change the world present their ideas. I\u2019m also sure that some of those businesses will go on to truly make a difference. Many of the businesses we met have a mobile core. A lot of them make apps providing a subscription service, some manage and analyze big data, and others are designed to improve our health care system. The hitch? None of them rely on advertising to generate revenue. A few years ago, before the rise of mobile, every new startup had a line item on its business plan that assumed some advertising revenue. I found this contrast a little startling and a little scary. My colleagues cautioned me not to read too much into this. They said that the startups we were meeting with were all early stage and focused more on the product than on revenue. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely true. I\u2019m actually impressed that most of the mobile-oriented startups I\u2019m seeing today \u2014 in Silicon Valley and New York \u2014 do have a plan for revenue. Usually, it\u2019s subscription or some other fee for service. And usually there\u2019s little to no assumption of advertising as a revenue stream. The startups I spoke with believe there are better ways to make money in mobile than advertising. I think this is very telling and worrisome for all the people reading this piece: Advertising on mobile devices is still broken. Most of the non-search budgets are going to display and everyone wonders whether tiny little banners at the bottom or top of the screen work. Search is the killer revenue driver and is locked up by the same companies that dominate desktop search. Targeting and geo-location tools are advancing rapidly, but they\u2019re being used to make poor creative units work a little better instead of re-shaping the whole mobile experience. Facebook and Twitter are doing a great job serving native ads on mobile devices and have shown us that native on mobile is a requirement. But how many more companies have been able to create native mobile experiences? A number of companies \u2014 like Tinder, Jelly and Spotify \u2014 are experimenting with the card design format (thanks to kbs+ Ventures director Taylor Davidson for pointing this out in his blog). But too many seem to still rely on the 300 x 50, and there still seems to be fundamental infrastructure problems. Reliable cross-device audience attribution is nearly impossible without first party data (e.g. log in info) and creative experiences are mostly horrible. The medium that most of us spend most of our time with is not an ideal way to engage customers outside of brand-owned apps. Startups are creating mobile businesses because we\u2019ve become a mobile society, but advertising is being left behind. As an industry, we don\u2019t seem to be working fast enough to fix these issues, and we don\u2019t seem entirely worried. Looking back on the rise of agencies, it seems like our growth has been connected to the rise of new mediums and media innovation. As the fortunes of TV went, so did our fortunes. As we applied innovation to the media-buying marketplace, we grew and our companies became more valuable. But what happens when the new medium isn\u2019t advertising-friendly and the people who are innovating in the medium aren\u2019t trying to make the medium work for advertising? I love this business, and I believe that some of the smartest and most innovative people work in this business. But I\u2019m a little worried that we\u2019re not moving fast enough to create meaningful mobile advertising experiences and we\u2019re not trying to solve the attribution and measurement challenges fast enough. On our tour of Silicon Valley, we met with a brilliant guy at Twitter. He said something like, \u201cMobile is hitting the nuclear reset button.\u201d He\u2019s right.",

Ranieri faces a similarly formidable challenge if he is to lift Fulham out of the doldrums.\nBut he believes the Londoners can be competitive again. He will take charge of his first game in 10 days\u2019 time when Fulham welcome fellow strugglers Southampton to Craven Cottage.\n\u201cThis Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table.

The number 114 is significant because it recognizes the 114,000 plus patients still waiting for organ donations in the country.\nThis was followed by chaplain Beachy stressing the importance of organ donation. He stated that he has multiple family members who have benefited from organ donations themselves.\nLori Knitt, Vice President of Nursing at Aurora Sheboygan said this is not unique.

Savvy content marketers are on top of the latest industry trends, and optimize for timely keywords that get the most traction. Google Trends is a great tool to utilize to learn about industry trends and ideas for timely content.\nScope Out the Competition: To understand how to better market your business, it\u2019s crucial to check out your competition and determine what they are doing differently. It\u2019s not enough to just visit their website or social media profiles, but you should also analyze the type of content they are producing and how their followers engage with their content.\nListen to Your Customers: The point of social media is to be social. Praises of quality customer service are always great to have, but when it comes to receiving reviews that are not so pleasant, be sure to acknowledge areas of improvement and implement new strategies to increase the quality of your products or services.\nDevelop Contacts: Establishing relationships is an integral component of gaining a following of your brand. Networking with patrons of your business and engaging with potential customers is a hands-on method of creating a list of contacts. By developing business contacts, you\u2019re also given another opportunity to engage with them by sending email newsletters and adding them on other social media profiles.\nAdvertise and Promote: Sometimes it takes spending a little more to profit from your work. Utilizing marketing and advertising tools such as Google AdWords, or social media advertising platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter are great means of putting your business at the forefront of users who are searching for products or services that you offer.",

    "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Why is GeForce NOW only available through NVIDIA's SHIELD family of devices?\n\nPassage: On October 1,NVIDIA Corporation formally launched its long-awaited cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW. For $7.99 per month, GeForce NOW gives members instant access to more than 50 PC games -- no discs, downloads, or software updates required -- including AAA titles likeBatman: Arkham Origins and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.And GeForce NOW can do so without sacrificing the quality or responsiveness gamers demand; it&apos;s the first cloud-gaming service capable of streaming at 60 frames per second at full 1080p HD.\nAnd if its price didn&apos;t immediately invoke a mental comparison to certain popular video streaming platform, NVIDIA left no room for doubting its intentions by describingGeForce NOW as \"a revolutionary game-streaming service -- the Netflix of games.\"\nAfter all, similar to Netflix, NVIDIA&apos;s GeForce NOW primarily operates on an unlimited streaming model. Though more similar to Amazon Instant Video, GeForce NOW also lets players purchase and stream hit new releases for an additional cost, such as The Witcher 3 and Resident Evil: Revelations 2.\nJust one \"problem\"But there&apos;s a catch: GeForce NOW is only available through NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD family of devices. As it stands, that means you can only subscribe to GeForce NOW if you own one of NVIDIA&apos;s $299 SHIELD portable handhelds, a high-powered NVIDIA SHIELD tablet starting at $299, or -- most recently -- a $199 SHIELD Android TV console.\nLeft to right: NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Android TV, and SHIELD Tablet. Image source: NVIDIA.\nPart of this requirement stems from the fact that NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD family is powered by its own Tegra series mobile superchips, which NVIDIA can ensure will work seamlessly with the Kepler architecture-based GPUs contained in the remote servers that host the games. To be sure, it only seems rational that, served to a similar-sized audience, NVIDIA&apos;s sheer computing, hardware, and bandwidth requirements for handling interactive games from the cloud would easily trump Netflix&apos;s comparatively \"simple\" one-way display of video content.\nOf course, this might be a moot point if NVIDIA&apos;s SHIELD devices were wildly popular. But while each piece of SHIELD hardware has its merits, the simple fact is that NVIDIA has sold very few overall.\nTo be fair, NVIDIA hasn&apos;t disclosed exactly how many SHIELD tablets, portables, and Android TV units are out there. But we can glean an estimate from a battery-related recall of the SHIELD Tablet issued in July, which NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang admitted involves \"most\" SHIELD Tablets the company has sold to date. A subsequent press release from theU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reveals that the recall covers 83,000 SHIELD tablets sold between July 2014 and July 2015 in the U.S., and another 5,000 affected devices in Canada.\nThat said, this doesn&apos;t give us an idea of SHIELD Android TV or Portable sales. But SHIELD Android TV was only just introduced this past March, and the SHIELD Portable doesn&apos;t exactly boast the same consumer appeal as the SHIELD tablet. It&apos;s no wonder, then, that the three devices have collectively had little material impact on NVIDIA&apos;s top or bottom lines so far.\nApples and orangesBy contrast, Netflix added3.3 million subscribers in the second quarter alone, ending the period with more than 65 million streaming customers.And as any technologically aware consumer can attest, part of the allure of Netflix is its relative ubiquity in a vast array of electronic devices. No matter which television, Blu-ray player, streaming media stick or gaming console you purchase, you can generally rest assured the Netflix logo will be available the first time you press the power button. Heck, even SHIELD users can effortlessly speak the words \"launch Netflix\" into their controllers to browse their favorite TV shows and movies.\nThat&apos;s not to say NVIDIA SHIELD won&apos;t continue to expand its reach. Since the initial launch, the SHIELD team has announced new curated content for the devices on a weekly basis. And less than two weeks ago, NVIDIA announced the availability of SHIELD Android TV in the U.K., France, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Also last month, Google began offering SHIELD as an accessory to all current and prospective Google Fiber customers in Provo, Utah, Kansas City, Missouri, and Austin, Texas.\nBut to realize GeForce NOW&apos;s full potential, NVIDIA needs to find a way to make the service accessible through a much broader array of hardware devices, ideally from multiple manufacturers. Unless that happens, it remains unlikely NVDIA will ever be able to accurately call GeForce NOW the \"Netflix of games.\"\nThe article The No. 1 Reason NVIDIA Can&apos;t Be the Netflix of Games...Yet originally appeared on Fool.com.\nSteve Symington owns shares of NVIDIA.

    "It was a bright Sunday 17th March when we met at Sawbridgeworth station for Trevor\u2019s walk. The sun shone and the wind, though brisk, was pleasant.\nOff we went along the towpath by the River Stort. Quite a few houseboats were by the river\u2019s edge although nobody could be seen. The towpath was muddy but that was insignificant as the weather changed dramatically. At one moment we would have our hats off, jackets half undone and the next minute we would be cowering from a hailstorm. It is true that in England you can have all four seasons in one hour. We did! When the weather was good we were able to look around and see signs of spring everywhere, from buds on trees to already flowering forsythia. We saw a small creature swim across the river but it was too swift for us to identify and it hid in the river bank.\nInevitably on a seven mile walk a comfort break was required but squatting amongst brambles is not the way. No names but the shrieks could be heard for a hundred yards.\nWe had our packed lunches at Thorley Church, in their well maintained churchyard. It even had a table and chairs for us plus, big bonus, the church hall was open so we could use their loo. Eileen brought out a cake that was left over from her church do the previous evening and we all voted it a very good cake, as did the robin that kept us company.\nOn with the walk, through a former WW11 airfield. We stopped for a moment which allowed me to take a photo of us standing in sunshine with a black cloud looming behind. That black cloud was to come over us later. We struggled to find the path about here as the land seemed to be owned by a paintball firm. Eventually we made our way through and then, as we crossed an open field with no shelter, that black cloud hit us. Horizontal hailstones! All of us now had wet trousers but wet only on the right side where the hail lashed us.\nWe passed a building which housed, according to a sign outside, members belonging to the NFBA. Never heard of it? The clue was in the other organisation listed, the Herts and Essex Cricket Academy. Batsman could be heard facing up to fast bowling in readiness for the new season. I never knew there was a National Fast Bowling Academy.\nGetting tired now, we elected to go straight back to Sawbridgeworth station with a plan to stop in a pub if we found one. Alas, there was no pub open on late Sunday afternoon in March on our route and, unrefreshed, we dragged our weary bodies back to the station to make our way home.\nIs there any information mentioned in the text about the National Fast Bowling Academy and the Herts and Essex Cricket Academy?

    "Who would have thought teens would still read British girls\u2019 boarding-school stories in the 21stcentury? I suppose this topic came to be because my niece is home from boarding school and I was going through her books. Outside of my small group, though, who\u2019d would want to read about a plucky new girl scoring the winning goal in lacrosse when there are powerful wizards, alluring vampires and enterprising undercover spies out there on the bookshelves, fictitious teenagers saving much more interesting and dangerous worlds?\nWell, plenty of readers, it seems, because the British girls\u2019 boarding-school novel made a surprising comeback from 2007, beginning with Sara Lawrence\u2019s High Jinx. Carmen Reid\u2019s St Jude\u2019s series about Gina Peterson and her friends began in 2008 and numbers six books to date. The Saffina Desforges writing team (which included two teenagers) released the entertaining St Mallory\u2019s Forever! earlier this year.\nSo what are the main differences between the classic British girls\u2019 boarding-school stories of the past and the ones that are being written now?\nToday\u2019s fictional boarding-school girls have relationships. They meet hot boys in town on Saturdays and smuggle them into parties at school. Chastity Maxwell in High Jinx even \u2018shags the handyman\u2019 in the sixth-form boarding-house.\nThey\u2019re not all into boys, of course. Some of them date girls. Today\u2019s fictional lesbian schoolgirls are out and proud \u2013 you don\u2019t have to read between the lines as you did with the Chalet School back in the day.\nThey might look and read like chick lit for teenage girls, but contemporary British girls\u2019 boarding-school stories cover some serious issues. What\u2019s it like to have your dad come out as gay or have his business empire suddenly collapse, as happens to Amy in the St Jude\u2019s books. How do you deal with parental pressure to do well at school? How do you handle going to a boarding-school where your mum is one of the teachers? What happens when a jealous rival sends a photo of you partying to your strict Muslim father?\nOMG! The use of slang was a problem for the teachers at the Chalet School. They\u2019d go nuts if they heard the language of fictional schoolgirls today. Not only that, but the girls sneak out to smoke (and not always cigarettes\u2026) and smuggle booze into the dorm. But for all the partying, the girls have high expectations of themselves. Even the seemingly dizziest ones are serious about becoming a lawyer.\nThe most important similarity though is the friendships. Girls like Jinx, Gina and Helen are as loyal to their besties as Darrell, Joey and Dimsie ever were. Living together 24/7 brings them close together; they become family to each other, and support each other through work woes, parental break-up, body image struggles\u2026and, of course, those broken hearts.\nThere may not be opportunities to learn about potions or surveillance, but there are worse places for teenage characters to spend the best years of their lives. Based on the passage above, What are some of the serious issues that contemporary British girls\u2019 boarding-school stories address and how do they differ from the typical themes found in other young adult literature?",

    "What did Andrew Price discuss in his recent presentation about Blender development?\nGenerate according to: Blender 2.5 has been slowly progressing, as more developers start focusing on bug fixing, and well rounding, instead of Sintel (which has enjoy lots of success). Blender 2.55 beta was released on November 4th, and continues to build on Blender's ever growing series of betas. Despite the seemingly never ending cycle, progress is being made. Hundreds of bug fixes have been made, in fact during the last month more than 300 bugs reports were closed. However there are still bugs in the program, and so about the same number have bugs have been reported. Still if you check out Letwory Interactive, which publishes status updates on the development of Blender, it would appear that we are starting to close more bugs then are being reported. According to the developers, we could be expecting the final release somewhere in the next three to five months.\nAlso having to do with Blender development is a cool post made over at BlenderGuru.\nAndrew Price recently made an almost hour long presentation at the Blender Conference 2010, and now he has posted it as a video on the web. He also summed it up, for all of us who don't like watching 50 minute-long videos on the internet, as a series of photographs and short summaries on the same page. It is a very interesting summary of what Blender could do better, especially on it's website, as well as cointaing a gold mine of statistics about the Blender community. During the presentation he finally released the results of a large survey that he took a couple months ago, which was very interesting to look at.\nSo Blender development is continuing, and we are all looking forward to the great Blender 2.6 release, however if you want to start warming to it now, go download the latest Blender beta, and also feel free to help out Blender development by submitting more bug reports at Blender Projects (you will need to make an account there first though).",
    "Given the text: Are you an artist or musician just starting out? Are you anxious for your music to be heard by others, but don\u2019t know how to get it out there? Well, in this article I am going to give you some tips and advice on how to get noticed on Social Media! First let\u2019s talk about social media platforms that you can use to advertise your music. Great examples are Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Snapchat, Vine, YouTube, Soundcloud and Spotify. Soundcloud or Spotify: You can create your own profile on either application. You can then upload multiple songs you have written or covered. Personally, I think having a Soundcloud or Spotify is very important, because you can link your profile on other social media apps. Instagram/Facebook/Vine/Youtube/Twitter/Tumblr: Above, I talked about Soundcloud and Spotify. Now, in your social media profile you can put a web link to your Spotify or Soundcloud music profile. You can post videos or audio of your music for your friends/followers to see. If they are interested in hearing more, tell them to go check out more of your work on your Soundcloud or Spotify, which will be linked on your profile. Snapchat: You can send small video clips of you playing music to your friends, and if they are interested send them the link to your Spotify or Soundcloud. Now let me give you a few tips on how to have more people interested in hearing your work. If you have an Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Vine etc., dedicated to your music, follow other similar artist accounts. If they follow you back, message them and ask if they could listen to your music and you\u2019ll listen to their music as well. Try to perform in local places. Go around to restaurants or places that may allow you to play your music for a night. Post on your social media that you are performing there, and encourage people to come see you. It\u2019s a win-win situation for you and the restaurant or place you are performing at. More customers for them, and it will help you and your music get \u2018known\u2019. Hand out pamphlets with your social media information and your Soundcloud or Spotify so they can check out more of your music online. Make an artist website, all about your passion for music. Post videos of you performing, post when and where you are doing a gig, even blog. You can link this to other social media outlets as well. Have conversations with your friends/fans! If people give you feedback on your music, or compliment it, thank them for listening to your work. Being genuine and pleasant to fans may encourage get people to tell their friends about your music as well. Also, if you are playing out somewhere, ask them what songs they\u2019d like to hear. Being interactive with fans is important. Don\u2019t make EVERYTHING about marketing your music. Although it\u2019s great to promote yourself, don\u2019t make that your only priority. You need some balance between personal content and marketing content. There is general rule called the 80/20 rule. That means that 80% of your posts should be personal, humorous and entertaining. Keep it social and enjoyable. That leaves a good 20% for promoting and marketing your music career. Overall, I think the most important rule is to be yourself! What are some offline methods that musicians can use to promote their music, and how can they use social media to support these efforts?",

The air feels heavy, the world enclosed around me. I can see the droplets of fog moving toward me; I breathe them in, swallow them; the drops cling to my hair, my eyelashes. The sky feels close. The sky does not exist.\nAs I step off the hard concrete of the sidewalk and onto the soft, leaf-strewn path, the world shifts. The density of the trees now surrounding me begin to block out the reality that I am in the heart of a thriving city. With each step I enter further into a quieter world. My footsteps are muffled and the ground has a certain give, almost an elasticity beneath my feet. Before me, on either side of the path, redwood after redwood stands in silent vigil. Their dark trunks seem quiet, but the further I walk the more I hear new sounds. A slight creaking in the upper, slimmer branches. The softest splattering of water drops on leaves, as the fog condenses on twig and leaf, descending in widening pearls of water. The smallest drops of water can nourish these trees as they drink in through both their roots and branches. The fog lies so heavily upon this city grove that it obscures the uppermost branches of the redwoods, making the height of the trees seem nearly infinite; they disappear long before they end.\nAs I move toward the heart of this small yet encompassing forest the landscape becomes darker, the few glimpses of light beyond the woods standing out more starkly than the tree trunks themselves. Walking up to one of the redwoods I lay my hand upon its bark. At first sight it seems to be so rough, split open with massive chasms as the tree has grown ever larger over the decades. Yet under my fingers I realize this bark is soft, the fibers feeling like unwoven fabric to my touch. The faintest trace of moss grows upon the outer surface of the bark, fading imperceptibly to the reddish-brown of the tree\u2019s natural hue. Beneath my hand the tree feels so richly alive, yet so still, existing at a pace almost, but not quite, slower than I am capable of imagining.\nAs I turn my back to the tree and lean against it in full repose, I see a single leaf fall into my line of sight before settling anonymously upon the forest floor. The ground is everywhere strewn with brown leaves, a full covering that lets off a rich, fragrant scent; yet watching this single leaf fall I recognize that each of these leaves has made the journey from branch to floor in its own time and in its own way. Each one has a story, although perhaps few have a witness other than the tree that released it to the ground.\nAt last I separate myself from the tree on which I am leaning and continue through the woods to its edge. The pathway opens out; the pathway ends in rose blossoms.\nBut this one we may get right. Based on the passage above, Can you continue the story of the single leaf falling from the tree and its journey to the ground?",

    "Given the text: Applications are invited for an NIH funded postdoctoral position combining eye tracking and intracranial EEG recordings in humans to study the neural basis of face recognition, object recognition, and social and affective perception, at the University of Pittsburgh, USA.\nThe research will focus on understanding the dynamic neural code that underlies the recognition of faces, bodies, objects, facial expressions, and other social and affective stimuli and how this information guides, and is guided by, eye movements. Of particular interest is how this information is coded in interactive neural circuits at the level of large-scale brain networks. The neural data will primarily be local field potentials/ event related potential from intracranial surface electrodes (electrocorticography, ECoG), cortical depth electrodes, and subcortical depth electrodes in humans in conjunction with eye tracking. There is also the potential for studies involving direct cortical stimulation to assess how neural modulation alters visual perception.\nThe ideal applicant would hold a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering or a related field. Strong technical, computational, and statistical skills are required. Experience with combining eye tracking and electrophysiological data is required (for example, scalp EEG or MEG and eye tracking).

The Super 14 table would look very different from a Chiefs point of view had they managed to see off the Crusaders and Brumbies in the past fortnight but Foster is at least thankful his charges seem to be learning from their mistakes. Three in a row, and he might have been found lying on one of Gilbert Enoka's special reclining couches. \"The last two games have hurt us, not so much to lose but to lose two close games,\" he explained. \"To win this game is mentally important for us. When you come off two, pretty tight, gut-wrenching games, to win one that went down to the wire... showed we learned a big lesson from the last two games. \"Our challenge is now to put another one on the board.\" The first assignment will be against the Bulls, who suffered the rare ignominy of going down to the Blues on Friday night. But, as Foster pointed out, they are still ahead of his side on the all-important table. Winning is what the Highlanders need to do for the rest of the season. It was a pragmatic Greg Cooper who contemplated his side's predicament as they are left counting the steps on the ladder they will need to climb to pull themselves into the playoffs. But Cooper will take a stoic Southern Man approach to his side's final five games. \"We obviously have to win all of those games [to make the semifinals],\" Highlanders coach Cooper said. \"But I think rugby has to be bigger than that, we also have to respect who we play for. \"While the playoffs are there, it's also a matter of doing justice to the jersey, the region and your team-mates as well.\" Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How does the Highlanders coach plan on motivating his team for their remaining games of the season?",

As I was eating dinner last night I envisioned the leftover couscous with a steamed egg and a bit of bacon, parmesan, and parsley sprinkled on top. I made it for lunch today and it was AMAZING. I will seriously make this recipe again and again. I wish I had more leftover couscous so I could make this dish for lunch again tomorrow. I highly recommend this recipe!\nIf you don&rsquo;t have leftover couscous, see recipe here.\nCook the bacon in a small skillet over medium heat.

Enjoy.\nIf you don\u2019t have leftover couscous, see recipe here.\nI wanted a healthy pasta salad to serve with the Chicken Gyros with Tzatziki Sauce I was making for dinner. I found this recipe at Cookie and Kate that looked perfect and it used what I already had on hand which was very convenient. I love the texture of Israeli couscous and it soaked the flavor of the lemony vinaigrette up nicely. I also really enjoyed the subtle flavor and crisp texture of the raw vegetables.

They are terrific in soups, lasagna, rice, pasta, or on their own. I recently picked up a box of Israeli couscous, so when I stumbled upon this recipe from Kitchen Grrrrls, I couldn&rsquo;t resist making it. I adapted the recipe to suit our tastes and what I had on hand. I have to say, I LOVED THIS DISH! The Israeli couscous was light, flavorful, and had a great texture. The roasted veggies gave great flavor and texture to the couscous and topping it with salty feta was perfect. I paired this couscous with salmon and it was a healthy and delicious meal.

    "Can you provide some details about the application process and training process for students in the Youth Intern Program at Explora, as well as the roles of mentors and portfolios in supporting the program's goals? Answer according to: Explora, a children\u2019s museum and science center, is one of the most vibrant, stimulating, and fascinating places for children and adults alike, with a wide range of hands-on discovery exhibits about science, technology, and art. Many in Albuquerque know Explora as a special place for making science, technology, and art accessible to visitors, but fewer know that Explora has a hidden gem in its Youth Intern Program. In operation since 2004, the 2.5 year program offers low-income, high-achieving high school students an opportunity to learn science, technology, engineering, math, and art concepts, and to teach and serve as role models for children.\nDaisy, a recent graduate of the University of New Mexico, completed the Youth Intern Program in 2011. She was the first in her family to attend college. Today she has her undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and is working in a laboratory utilizing math to investigate biomedical topics. Daisy says that she fell in love with math after being paired with a scientist during her internship at Explora. She grew her passion for math by teaching and mentoring elementary students through Explora\u2019s educational programs.\nExplora\u2019s mission is \u201ccreating opportunities for inspirational discovery and the joy of lifelong learning through interactive experiences in science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM).\u201d The 2.5-year Youth Intern Program, designed for promising but disadvantaged high school students, exemplifies Explora\u2019s mission. Interns\u2019 exposure to STEAM learning, professional skills, and community involvement is expected to be a pathway out of poverty into a rewarding career. Interns also learn to question, explore, articulate, and then enjoy the rewarding experience of educating younger children. They develop strong ties to the community through outreach, and receive valuable mentoring to plan for college and career.\nExplora\u2019s Youth Intern Program has provided about 30 paid internships a year for low-income, high-achieving, and culturally diverse high school students in Albuquerque. Students are recommended by teachers and then apply during their sophomore year. To participate, they must qualify for federal lunch program. Once accepted, the sophomore interns join the junior and senior cohorts, and stay in the program for additional 2.5 years through senior year.\nOrientation Semester: Before being selected for full internships, interested sophomores who have been recommended by their teachers come to Explora during the spring semester to learn about the organization and about principles of experiential education, while developing essential workforce skills including effective work behaviors, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, and successful interviewing.\nCompetitive Application Process: To be selected for full internships, students must actively participate in the orientation semester, complete an application, provide two adult references, and interview at Explora with their adult sponsor or parent.\nMulti-Step Program: Once part of the team, student interns spend summers and afterschool hours learning about the exhibits and educational units delivered to elementary school students. Steps in the training process include experiencing a program as a student, experimenting with the program materials, learning the science behind the program, observing Explora educators, assisting Explora educators in providing the program, pairing with another intern to team-teach the program, and finally teaching the program solo to public elementary school students who come to the museum. The interactive, inquiry-based learning as well as the teaching assignments prepare students in STEAM concepts and also in community engagement.\nPortfolios: Interns maintain portfolios on their progress, including self-evaluations; Explora staff use portfolios and attendance data to evaluate the interns\u2019 performance and experience.\nMentors: Each intern is matched with a mentor who supports their job performance and helps them explore potential careers. Mentors also provide support for the students\u2019 high school academic programs, and assist in selecting and applying to colleges.\nStipends: Interns receive a stipend during the school year and summer.\n31 students participated in the program during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe interns facilitated STEM explorations for 8,054 low-income elementary school students.\nHow well do we do it?\n84% of interns were retained over the 2014-15 school year.\nIn 2014-15, interns accumulated at total of 8,200 contact hours, or an average of about 265 hours per student.\n100% of 12th grade interns graduated at the end of the 2014-15 school year.\n Martinez-Papponi, B., & Genn\u00e9 (2014).

    "It is my favorite song. Sung beautifully by Miranda Lambert. It is about a 20 something (she must be young) who is trying to find herself and goes to her childhood home. Well I'm not 20 anything, I found myself a long time ago, but for some reason as I plan my next move to our 8th residence in a 24 year marriage, I get a little nostalgic. This is the house my kids will most remember. But it is the house that \"built\" me I lovingly remember.\nI spent my preschool and elementary years in Clinton, Iowa. By the time we moved I was entering high school and was the only child at home. So the house in Clinton that was full of family is the one I pine for. It is a gorgeous English Tudor sitting on a large hill with views of the Mississippi River. It was once a retreat for an order of monks which explains the cross mowed into the lawn. It sat on an acre of property, most of it woods, and had a beautiful stone patio, an enormous screened in porch and a balcony from my parents room. The wood was heavy and dark, and every room had built in closets, dressers and shelves. The windows are were all leaded glass and there were 2 huge picture windows. In the spring there were dozens of lilac trees and bushes of peonies. In the summer we would have thousands of monarch butterflies and in the fall we would collect hedge apples and pine cones.\nChristmas was magical. My dad would string the big Charlie Brown bulbs all over the hedges and when the snow would fall they would glow in bursts of color. Our huge tree would proudly stand at the living room picture window. We would have cut it down ourselves and decorated with the dozens of family ornaments and tossed tinsel all over it. I never thought to look for the Christmas presents hidden on the screened in porch, but many years later I learned that was my mom's favorite place to hide them.\nOf course the house had a basement, and a pit in the garage that my brothers used to learn to work on their cars. And my favorite spot was the breakfast room with its octagonal shape and all the leaded windows. No one could come in either driveway without being seen. My last bedroom (I had to wait until the older sisters went to college), had a wall of windows that looked out over the river. It was such a magical place. I have the photographs and the memories, and this time of year makes me think of a particular cooking memory. In the Betty Crocker cooky cookbook that is falling apart, are the many recipes we made. I blogged about it before and decided that it was the perfect time to make Pumpkin Cookies. These are the cookies I made on September 24, 1976. The note next to the recipe says \"couldn't go skating\". It was a sad day. Every fall we had a roller skating party and it was the one night a year a 7th grade girl (in 1976) could hold hands to a Shawn Cassidy song and roller skate a memory. But alas, I didn't clean my room, and the meanest mom in the entire world made me stay home. She probably launched my love of baking and journaling through recipes. I remember the night clearly. It is, after these many years, a very happy memory. Needless to say I couldn't make the recipe as it is written, so here it is with my changes.\nOkay, my changes. Shortening does make a really soft cookie, but butter just tastes better. And I think raisins are yucky in a cookie, so chocolate chips, perfect replacement. The recipe says the cookies can be iced with a thin butter icing. Would you ice a chocolate chip cookie? I mean, the recipes are very similar. I say enjoy the pumpkin! This recipe makes about 6 dozen and they do not spread, so you can really cram them on the baking sheets.\nWhat is the significance of the screened-in porch in the author's childhood home during Christmas time?",

    "Here is a piece of text: When I was 14, the muscles necessary for me to chew and swallow became very weak. After months of high-calorie shakes and sometimes even straight H\u00e4agen-Dazs, my parents drove me to Sutter Memorial Hospital where I had a stomach tube placed. That small, plastic device has quite literally kept me alive for more than 20 years.\nA few years ago, my chest muscle lost the strength to fully expand my lungs. I exhausted every noninvasive therapy, and then it was time to head back to Sutter Memorial. I was taken into an operating room where a direct airway called a tracheotomy was placed in my neck. I could breathe easy yet again.\nAll of these medical challenges are the result of missing a single gene that is essential for proper muscle function. When I was diagnosed, the doctors told my parents we would never see a treatment to address the genetic underpinnings of this disease.\nHowever, a lot can happen in more than three decades, and late last year the FDA approved the first-ever treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. It was an amazing achievement.\nAnd then Sutter came through once again. The medication is extremely expensive, and in certain cases like mine, it can be very difficult to administer.\nYet when there is a group of people who are motivated by a genuine desire to have a positive impact on someone\u2019s life, the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes conceivable and then even achievable. In November, I became the first adult in the region to receive this groundbreaking treatment at a Sacramento hospital.\nThis most recent medical success would have never occurred without the efforts of Dr. Bradley Chipps, Dr. Shailesh Asaikar, Dr. Lotfi Hacein-Bey, Dr. Robert Moynihan, their nurses, support staff, and nameless other administrators who were all up for the challenge.\nIt takes excellent people to create excellent outcomes, and to each of them I express my immense gratitude.\nDavid Bekhour is a graduate of the UC Davis School of Law.

    "What is the general consensus on the texture and richness of the carrot pecan bread described in the material? Generate according to: After making so many rich and gooey things this week, I thought I\u2019d switch gears and make something kind of wholesome and useful. This carrot pecan bread recipe is based on an old recipe from a 1984 Southern Living annual, so it\u2019s (at least) 24 years old. Doesn\u2019t it seem strange that 1984 was 24 whole years ago? 1984 seems like yesterday. I hated the \u201980s but I sort miss them still. Anyway. This pecan bread, unlike the eighties, is not defined by excess. It has a low but reasonable amount of oil and all kinds of healthy (\u201960s!) ingredients like whole wheat flour, carrots and nuts. This was pretty darn healthy\u2026so I made it with one slight change \u2013 I replace some of the oil with ground Flax Seed. It was delish so I decided to blog about it to my friends\u2026thanks so much for the inspiration!!! It looks delish and I think it smells wonderful too, Anna! Mimi\u2019s is one of our favorite restaurants and I LOVE the carrot bread. Is there a recipe out there for it? We are now an hour away from the closest one and don\u2019t get there as often. Sigh. Looks right up my alley \u2013 I love the carrot bundt cake with applesauce in it that you posted some time back. This looks like a good everyday type loaf. I\u2019ve been missing the 80s lately, too. I think that shows how bad things are right now. Depressing! What I still can\u2019t believe is that I graduated high school in 1984. Where does the time go? Have you ever made the carrot bread from Mimi\u2019s restaurant? I used to love that stuff. Great \u2013 a recipe to use some KA whole wheat flour that\u2019s been waiting. Perfect timing as usual. BTW \u2013 my hubby loved the PB & Nutella Brownies. He\u2019d never had Nutella and they came out just pefectly. \u201cThis bread, unlike the eighties, is not defined by excess.\u201d Anna, you always manage to bring a smile to my face with your fun metaphors, haha \u2013 love it! And that bread sounds wonderful \u2013 carrot & pecan is a delectable combination! FYI. I weighed my flour and used a total of about 10 1/4 oz \u2014 6 oz all purpose, 4 1/4 oz whole wheat. This isn\u2019t nearly as rich and moist as carrot cake. It\u2019s definitely more of a quick bread \u2014 lower in fat, but not rubbery. Just today I bought a big bag of organic carrots to make baby food and was thinking I needed to search for something else to make with the leftovers\u2026Anna to the rescue! Looks yummy, and you\u2019re right, after all the ooey, gooey stuff, I\u2019m thinking healthy. I\u2019m about to make a healthy whole grain type muffin.

    "Home Customizing Dynamics CRM Sub-Report Not Displaying? Here\u2019s a Workaround 7 people are discussing this now.\nHow to create reports without using sub-reports.\nWhen building a custom FetchXML-based SSRS report with this type of data, most developers will gravitate towards displaying the account information in a report and passing the accounted to sub-report that displays the contact information. This may not be the best option for several reasons.\nThey can have some performance issues with loading more slowly due to multiple reports.\nThey can be difficult to manage. It\u2019s easier to manage one report than to manage multiple reports. Each sub-report is a separate RDL (report definition file).\nWith Dynamics CRM reporting, each sub-report should have a separate data source because Dynamics CRM does not support shared data sources.\nThis blog assumes that the readers have knowledge on how to use FetchXML to develop custom SSRS report for Dynamics CRM. Our focus today is not to show how to create a FetchXM-based report, but to how show a technique that helps us build this report without a sub-report.\nAlso, we\u2019ll be making this a \u201cform-based\u201d report, meaning this report can be run from an Account form by selecting the report from the ribbon (versus being run from the Reports area).\nWhen to build SQL based report and when to build FetchXML based report.\nHow to get the ID of the record that is opened and pass it to the report query as parameter. This is called pre-filtering in Dynamics CRM, which is required for form based reports.\nWithout further ado, here are the steps!\nCreate a Dataset i.e FilterDS to pull accountid while enabling prefiltering. This will enable the report to grab the GUID of the account the report is run from.\nCreate a parameter called account of datatype text.\nRight click the parameter account. Under properties, set the available and default value to point to the FilterDS and the accountid field as the value.\nNow create the main dataset (master dataset) for the account as you see below and apply the filter accountid equals the parameter @account.\nAlso create the detail dataset for contact and filter on parentcustomerid as you see below.\nNotice the @account parameter is key in both of these datasets. @account contains the ID (GUID) of the account record that the report is run for.\nThis will take care of the need to use sub-reports while still using the awesome feature of Dynamics CRM called Report Parameter Pre-filtering.\nby Joe D365\tFebruary 18, 2013 7 people are discussing this now.

    "Teodora Mitze-Circiumaru, a native of Romania, met her husband, Levi, while they were students at Mercer College in Georgia. They moved to Meridian this summer so Levi could teach at Meridian High School. Teodora uses her music skills as an organist at First Christian Church in Meridian.\nLiving thousands of miles apart as children Levi and Teodora Mitze-Circiumaru never knew their love for music would one day bring the two together \u2013 or to Meridian.\nLevi Mitze-Circiumaru teaches Algebra I at Meridian High School and Teodora is the organist at First Christian Church where the two attend. As a young girl in Romania, Teodora started playing the piano when she was in fourth grade. She later discovered in high school she wanted to play the organ and began to take private lessons.\nLevi is also a musician having played the violin since the age of eight. He plays the violin at First Christian Church occasionally.\nThe two met when Teodora came to America in 2014 to pursue an Artist Diploma at Mercer University in Macon, Ga. Levi was at the university finishing his undergraduate degree in violin and computer science. Being from Romania Teodora said her first time to America was a little bit of a culture shock.\nAfter finishing her Artist Diploma, Teodora was offered a job in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. During the year they were living there, Levi Mitze-Circiumaru had the opportunity to play with several professional orchestras. But, the best experience was when the two had a second wedding with Teodora\u2019s family in Sibiu, Romania, Levi said.\n\u201cThe ceremony was held at the Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral of Saint Mary \u2013 it was an incredible experience,\u201d Levi said. \u201cThis city is like a medieval town, well preserved. So much beautiful architecture with a deep history.\nAfter living in Romania for a year the Mitze-Circiumarus decided to return to the states so Teodora could get her doctoral degree at Florida State University. While living in Florida, Levi Mitze-Circiumaru became interested in a program \u2013 The Mississippi Teacher Corps. A program that eventually led them to Meridian.\n\u201cThe program takes people who don\u2019t have degrees in education but are suited to teach in a high need subject, like mathematics,\u201d Mitze-Circiumaru said. \u201cIn return for a full tuition masters degree from the University of Mississippi, you can commit to teaching for two years in a high need school somewhere in Mississippi.\nThe Mitze-Circiumaru\u2019s said since moving to Meridian a month ago they haven\u2019t had much spare time, but when they do they enjoy playing music together, reading and watching movies.\nLevi Mitze-Circiumaru moved to Meridian with his wife, Teodora, so he could teach algebra at Meridian High School through the Mississippi Teacher Corps program. Their love of music brought the couple together. Levi, who previously has played violin with some orchestras, sometimes shares his talent with First Christian Church in Meridian.\nWhat is the Mississippi Teacher Corps program, and how did it bring the Mitze-Circiumaru's to Meridian?",

    "Can you summarize the Iowa Crop Progress and Condition report released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistical Service for the week ending September 3, 2017?: DES MOINES \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey today commented on the Iowa Crop Progress and Condition report released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistical Service. The report is released weekly from April through October.\n\u201cAs we enter September crops continue to move towards maturity with harvest now just a few weeks away. It is great to see some farmers aerially seeding cover crops. Seed corn harvest is also getting underway,\u201d Northey said.\nIt was a cool dry week in Iowa during the week ending September 3, 2017, according to USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Statewide there were 6.2 days suitable for fieldwork. Activities for the week included haying, hauling grain, chopping corn silage, seeding cover crops, and harvesting seed corn.\nTopsoil moisture levels rated 13 percent very short, 27 percent short, 59 percent adequate and 1 percent surplus. According to the August 29, 2017 U.S. Drought Monitor, areas of south central and southeast Iowa have been in a severe drought for 5 consecutive weeks. Subsoil moisture levels rated 17 percent very short, 31 percent short, 52 percent adequate and 0 percent surplus.\nNinety-four percent of the corn crop was in or beyond the dough stage, five days behind last year but three days ahead of the five-year average. Sixty percent of the corn crop has reached the dent stage, eight days behind last year and three days behind average. Corn condition rated 62 percent good to excellent. Eighteen percent of soybeans have started to turn color, five days behind last year and three days behind average. Soybean condition improved to 61 percent good to excellent. There were scattered reports of disease issues in soybeans such as sudden death syndrome.\nThe third cutting of alfalfa hay reached 91 percent complete, 8 days ahead of last year and over 2 weeks ahead of average. Pasture condition rated 16 percent very poor, 23 percent poor, 35 percent fair, 24 percent good and 2 percent excellent. Cooler temperatures have been ideal for livestock; however, there were still reports of producers in south central and southeast Iowa feeding hay to cattle due to poor pasture conditions.\nIt was a dry and unseasonably cool week across Iowa. Temperatures were below normal throughout the week except at a few western Iowa locations. Monday (28th) and Friday (1st) were the coolest days in most areas with daytime highs in the seventies. Temperature extremes for the week ranged from Friday (1st) morning lows of 41 degrees at Cresco and Elkader to a Saturday (2nd) afternoon high of 86 degrees at Albia. Temperatures for the week as a whole averaged from four to seven degrees below normal over the east to slightly above normal in the far northwest with a statewide average of 3.0 degrees subnormal. Most of the week\u2019s rain came on Sunday (27th) when rain was scattered nearly statewide with some very small areas of heavy rain in the Dubuque and Burlington areas. There were some thunderstorms on Monday over extreme eastern Iowa, with some localized heavy rains around Burlington. There were some isolated showers on Thursday (31st), Friday (1st) and Saturday (2nd) but with rain totals mostly under one-tenth of an inch. Asbury in Dubuque County reported the most rain for the week with 3.31 inches while Burlington saw 2.72 inches. Much of central and south central Iowa saw little, if any rain. The statewide average rainfall amount was 0.11 inches while normal for the week is 0.88 inches. This was the state\u2019s driest week in 12 weeks (mid-June). At Fairfield the summer rainfall total (June-July-August) was only 3.51 inches. This was their lowest summer rain total among 137 years of records at that location (old record 3.77 inches in 1911). The Ottumwa Airport recorded even less rain for the summer with 3.38 inches, but this amount ranked a distant second behind 1911\u2019s 1.80 inch total at that location.",

    "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What release date has been set for the new Jumanji film, and what competition will it face at the box office?\n\nGiven material: Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a massive hit, so a sequel wasn't exactly a huge surprise. However, considering the major ways the film updated the premise of the original Jumanji from over 20 years earlier, it was far from clear how the third Jumanji film would differentiate itself. While we still don't have many of those answers, we do know one thing, our heroes will end up in new costumes in the upcoming film, and that's something. Check out Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan's new outfits in the image below.\nWhile new costumes might not be massive breaking news, it would seem to tell us something about the new movie. A recent image of the cast from Karen Gillan had shown the main cast in the same clothes that they wore in the first film. It's unclear if this image was actually from the new movie or the previous one, but either way, it implied that we'd be getting the actors in the same outfits we got before. Although, it did promise things were not as they seemed, so perhaps this was part of the reason. When we actually saw the characters in the new film, they would look a little different.\nSince they're playing video game avatars, it would make sense that the characters would end up in the same clothes, and it's possible they may start out that way, but at some point things will change, as the Rock's Instagram picture reveals.\nBased on the outfits, it looks like Jumanji 3 may be taking our characters into a colder environment, as they're clearly dressed for keeping warm. Even Ruby Roundhouse as left her Lara Croft inspired shorts and crop top behind for fuzzy boots and long sleeves.\nShifting the setting of the new Jumanji from the tropical jungle to something colder is certainly one way to change things up. The \"ice level\" is a tried and true element of many great video games, so it would certainly be fitting to have the video game inspired Jumanji 3 use the idea as part of its premise.\nThe Rock's comment on his Instagram post also appears to confirm that Jumanji 3 will continue the story of the romance between the characters of Spencer and Martha. The teenagers inhabiting the two video game avatars began a relationship in Welcome to the Jungle and it seems the pair are no less awkward even though some time has passed since they got together.\nJumanji 3 is filming right now with a release date already set for this December. It will once again go up against the newest Star Wars movie at the box office, though that battle wasn't a major problem for Jumanji the last time around. With a fan base already looking forward to this sequel, it seems highly likely another big box office hit is on the way.",

    "Indirect grilling requires little hands-on attention, but gives you maximum flavor. It's like slow cooking, but on the grill!\nThis technique is called indirect grilling, but it\u2019s more like roasting, which means indirect heat, lower temps and longer cooking times.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to get started, pull the beef out of the fridge and season well. Depending on your recipe, now\u2019s the time to apply a rub, herbs or other spices.\nTake a few minutes to configure your grill. As the name suggests, indirect grilling positions the beef away from the heat source instead of directly over it. If you\u2019re using charcoal, this means arranging the coals off to one side of the grill and cooking on the opposite side. If you\u2019re using gas, refer to your owner\u2019s manual and bring the grill to medium heat on one side only.\nKeep the lid closed for best results. You should follow your recipe for timing, but also may want to use an oven-proof meat thermometer to confirm when time\u2019s almost up. Be careful not to overshoot your target temperature because it will continue to rise for several minutes after coming off the grill.\nDon\u2019t skip this step! Resting is essential to keep all those delicious juices from draining out of the meat, and makes the next step easier. The larger cuts that work best for indirect grilling generally need more time to rest\u2014often up to 15\u201320 minutes. Set the meat on your cutting board or a serving tray and cover it loosely with aluminum foil (this is called \u201ctenting\u201d).\nWhen you\u2019re ready to carve, take care to not pierce the beef with a fork. Instead just use tongs to hold the roast in place. Depending on your recipe or desired presentation, slice the beef thinly across the grain and serve on a warm plate or tray.\nResting time is important because it allows the juices to stay in the meat, becoming easier to carve and serve.\nAn underrated component of any grill set-up, a drip pan\u2014usually made of disposable foil\u2014 catches drippings from your meat, preventing dangerous flare-ups.\nCraving a hearty salad? Beef Tri-Tip Roast is marinated in a tangy balsamic vinaigrette and cooked on the grill.

North America holds a lot of new technology and everything is new and spectacular to him, the trains, the enormous rock sculptures and an endless farming field are examples of this. There is also a bad side to this place; there are huge cities of factories and tall buildings with thick smoke coming out of each building.\nBut above all, best place was California, where there were a strong sunlight, the Sierra Mountains and the seacoast. Along the way he had met and shook hands new people, which had different cultural backgrounds to him.\nThis setting is constructed in a way that the more the grandfather travels the more he liked it and wanted to make the \u2018New World\u2019 his home. This setting shows that the cultural barrier can be broken and people should go out and see the world and meet new people to develop more familiarity of the world they live in.\nQuestion 3.

On the next page it shows the transition to the \u2018New World\u2019. The background colours have changed from dull to bright and he had changed into European clothes. The wave that looks very unsteady shows the \u2018New World\u2019. All this happens when you want to \u2018see the world.\nQuestion 5. Discuss the attitudes and values of the text and your personal response to these.\nQuestion 6. Describe at least one link you can make between this book and another/other texts you have read or viewed. How do the texts compare in terms of the ideas presented and how do you respond to these ideas?\nOne of the pages in this book makes us realise that we often label Japan as the enemy in World War II, whilst they were also the victim and had also suffered a large amount of devastation. In the film Pearl Harbour, one of the scenes was Japan bombing Pearl Harbour. This only shows the negative side of Japan, where they were attackers, but it did not show them as the victims suffering from the disaster. This movie is persuading the audience to blame Japan for the damages of the war, where Japan had to go through the emotional breakdowns and physical injuries.\nEven though the book tells us not to blame Japan for the damages and the movie shows us that Japan was the enemy in World War II, there is still a link between the two texts and that is after a war majority of the participating countries will have, no matter large or small, havocs. I think, because of this, we should not blame a certain country for the occurrence of the war, and should not blame any country since the countries that participated are both enemies and victims of the war.\nMedusa by Carol an Duffy, Loads of Mistakes.\nHow are language and graphics used together to shape the reader's response in the Grandfather's Journey?

Why or why not?\n\nPassage: Nabi\u2019s kids-oriented tablets have carved out a nice space for themselves at the low-end of the market, but the brand\u2019s new 20-inch and 24-inch devices are taking a significantly, well, bigger approach.\nAt $449.99 and $549.99 respectively, the Big Tab HD line is a sizable investment for your child\u2019s entertainment and education. When I first got my hands on the 10.5-pound 20-inch model, my first thought was, \u201cHow will kids even pick this thing up?\u201d The 24-inch version weighs even more at a whopping 13 pounds.\nBig Tab HD packs an Nvidia Tegra 4 CPU, 2GB of RAM, a rear-facing camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC. The operating system is based on Android 4.4, with Nabi\u2019s Blue Morpho custom kid-friendly launcher. The 20-inch uses a 1600 x 900 resolution, while the 24-inch is 1920 x 1080.\nGiven the relatively low pixel density of the tablets, the larger display on the 20-inch version wasn\u2019t awesome. The touchscreen also felt less responsive than normal-sized devices.\nI was curious to see how kids responded to it, so I brought it out at a couple of get-togethers with kids ranging in age from 6-14. The device was a hit, and the parents enjoyed the fact that their kids were playing together instead of just hanging out on separate screens. The group quickly found the multiplayer options in games like Fruit Ninja and air hockey, eventually deciding on a four-player tank game called Don\u2019t Fall in the Hole as their favorite.\nPre-installed games include classics like checkers, chess, tic tac toe and hangman. You\u2019ll also have access to Show Time \u2013 a store for movies and books from Disney, Dreamworks and more \u2013 and drawing apps that are great for doodling.\nThe tablet comes with a metal frame that doubles as a handle and a stand. It\u2019s useful, but it adds more bulk to an already bulky setup. With the stand, you could conceivably rely on Big Tab HD as a replacement for your kids\u2019 TV, but you\u2019d have to find alternative sources for content instead of DVDs and satellite television.\nBig Tab HD includes a parent mode that lets you bypass the custom interface in order to use the device as a regular Android tablet. The experience was sub-par, but I did manage to do some browsing and install a few apps, including Netflix and a four-player beer pong app, from Google Play. I\u2019d love to see tabletop gaming apps such as Settlers of Catan take advantage of the big screen, but I\u2019m doubtful that Nabi will sell enough units to warrant custom builds from developers.\nWhile Big Tab HD succeeded at entertaining my friends\u2019 kids, it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice for a family-oriented tablet. I\u2019d rather have a smaller device, like the Amazon Fire HD Kids Edition tablet, that\u2019s easy to take to restaurants or out on road trips and flights.\nCarting out a 20-inch tablet gets kids and adults alike excited, but it also feels like more gimmick than substance. Sure, we could play a few games on it for an evening, but eventually it\u2019d end up just collecting dust because of how heavy and cumbersome it is. If you have multiple kids that would benefit from sharing a screen, you might get enough value out of this super-sized tablet, but otherwise, I suggest you pass.",

    "Spring has sprung, and it's time to breathe in the fresh air and celebrate all things outdoorsy. Happily, spring is the perfect season for doing crafts and getting messy, both of which can be great practice for kids with fine motor issues. Try these activities to help your kiddo build his or her motor skills while celebrating everything that's wonderful about spring.\nEven if your family doesn't celebrate Easter, decorating eggs is a really fun and relatively simple project. Use toothbrushes, paintbrushes and cotton swabs to decorate hard-boiled eggs with paint and glitter, or give kids plastic eggs to decorate with stickers, glue and jewels. Working with small objects forces kids to hone their fine motor skills.\nDigging holes and planting new seeds is another perfect fine motor activity for spring, and even apartment dwellers can do it. First, let kids finger-paint their own small flower pots. Then supervise while they fill pots with soil, add seeds, cover them with more soil and water them. Repeat this with several small pots to make your own indoor herb garden, which kids can then water regularly.\nBird seed is tiny, so handling it will always force kids to use fine motor skills. Go the old-school route by having kids smear peanut butter all over a pine cone and coating the whole thing with bird seed, or help them assemble their own bird feeders from kits and fill them with seed. Add a counting element, like asking kids to find 10 pellets that are all the same color, to force them to use their fingers or plastic tweezers to separate out the tiny pieces.\nRainy days are a regular part of spring in many parts of the country, which makes rainbows a perfect project for this time of year. Creating rainbow projects often requires fine motor skills because kids have to get a lot of different colors into a small space. Have them cut strips of paper to make rainbow wall hangings, or glue individual beads or sequins in a rainbow shape onto poster board. Based on the passage above, Can you suggest some spring activities that can help children develop their fine motor skills?",

    "Summarize the concept of a Warrior-Mage hero and provide examples of this character in modern literature.: Traditionally, heroes can be divided into two areas. The lower area belongs to heroes who perform small deeds. A hero of this caliber may discover the chink in the Black Knight's armor, but he would not kill him. He leaves that to the higher-level heroes. These heroes perform great deeds of heroism in the tradition of Beowulf and Saint George, slaying dragons and monsters. Above these heroes reside savior characters like Frodo, Aragorn, and Arthur, and above them are the gods. But Luke Skywalker fits none of these characteristics. He does not kill Vader or the Emperor, and he uses magic, in the form of the Force. While his weapon is a sword, the traditional weapon of a knight, it is missing the symbolic crosspiece of Arthurian knights. While he is on a journey to become a knight, he also learns to use magic.\nThroughout traditional literature there is a strong differentiation between the characters that can and cannot use magic. Wizards are able to use magic. Demons are able to use magic. Normal humans can not use it. Merlin was able to use magic as a result of being half spirit, or perhaps even half demon. Arthur, on the other hand, never uses magic. Here, in Star Wars, is the first institution of a new class of hero, the Warrior-Mage. Now this character is common throughout modern fantasy and science fiction literature. A warrior-mage, or paladin as they are sometimes cast, is a knight-like character who is capable of using magic. In Shigeru Miyamato's The Legend of Zelda, Link takes on this role with the acquisition of a magical sword and the mystical Triforce. In The Matrix all of humanity awaits the arrival of \"The One\" who can use the powers of the Matrix against the powers that be. But while this character is common today, it is very difficult to find him in works that date before the early 1900s.",

    "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: How did the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres fare in their recent head-to-head games?\n\nGiven material: LOS ANGELES \u2014 Yu Darvish didn\u2019t have to be perfect on Monday. Logan Forsythe didn\u2019t have to hit for the cycle.\nIn a game that was over early and meant little, at least they offered the announced crowd of 49,419 at Dodger Stadium a remote measure of suspense.\nDarvish took a perfect game into the fifth inning of the Dodgers\u2019 9-3 victory over the San Diego Padres, while Forsythe went 3 for 3 with four RBI. He finished a triple shy of the cycle.\nThe nine runs were the most the Dodgers have scored in a game since July 19, but it barely resembled a tune-up for the postseason. Three Padres pitchers \u2013 Travis Wood, Cory Mazzoni and Tim Melville \u2013 saw their earned-run averages grow to 6.71, 18.00, and 7.71 respectively. The caliber of competition can only increase.\nFor a day at least, there were plenty of confidence-builders to go around.\nAustin Barnes got a rare start at second base and hit a three-run home run against Mazzoni in the fifth inning. Forsythe hit a solo home run against Wood. Yasmani Grandal went 2 for 4 with a double \u2013 0 for 2 as a right-handed hitter and 2 for 2 as a lefty. Every starting position player reached base at least once.\nMaybe the man with the most to build on was Darvish (10-12). In what figured to be his penultimate regular-season start, the right-hander allowed one earned run over seven innings. In nine starts as a Dodger, his ERA is 3.44.\nSince he arrived in a deadline-day trade with the Texas Rangers, Darvish\u2019s ability to spin a baseball has been unassailable. So is his fastball, which touched 97 mph against San Diego. Darvish had been hampered by a few mechanical kinks, which the team attributed to the recovery process from his 2015 Tommy John surgery. The kinks diminished to the point where they were not a factor Monday.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m in really good position physically and mentally,\u201d Darvish said through an interpreter.\nFor all his weapons as a pitcher, Darvish struggled with efficiency for much of August. His command was unpredictable. Against the Padres, Darvish did not walk a batter and struck out nine. He completed seven innings for just the third time since the trade.\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke glowingly of Darvish\u2019s rapport with pitching coach Rick Honeycutt. Not only did Darvish implement Honeycutt\u2019s mechanical recommendations, Roberts said, the two men are on the same page when scouting opponents prior to each start.\nGrandal said the key to Darvish\u2019s turnaround \u2013 two earned runs in his last three starts \u2013 is more fundamental.\nNo Padres reached base against Darvish until Cory Spangenberg was hit by a pitch in the fifth inning. The next batter, Hunter Renfroe, hit a double. Spangenberg scored on the play, dashing Darvish\u2019s chance at a perfect game, a no-hitter and a shutout in less than a minute.\nBy then, however, the Dodgers had built a five-run cushion.\nMaking his first appearance since he was sent to the bullpen, right-hander Kenta Maeda allowed a pair of runs in the eighth inning. One scored on a throwing error, and the only two hits he allowed were weak infield singles.\nBeleaguered right-hander Pedro Baez allowed a pair of hits in the ninth inning but struck out three, including Austin Hedges to strand runners on second and third base to end the game.\nWith five games remaining in the regular season, the Dodgers reached 100 wins in a season for the first time since 1974. The franchise record for wins in a season is 105, set in Brooklyn in 1953. If all five of the Dodgers\u2019 remaining games were against the Padres, they would have a better chance of tying the record.\nThere\u2019s a more practical matter at stake. The Dodgers (100-57) moved 1\u00bd games ahead of the idle Cleveland Indians (98-58) for the best record in Major League Baseball, with home-field advantage throughout the postseason at stake.\nThey can clinch home-field advantage through at least the National League Championship Series as early as Tuesday. Only the Washington Nationals (95-61) can catch the Dodgers now. Any two losses by Washington, or two wins by the Dodgers, would do the trick.",

    "We made good old chicken pot pie Halloween party-worthy by loading up the filling with fresh vegetables and herbs, and decorating the top with bones and skulls cut from puff pastry. You'll need special cookie cutters; or you can create your own skull and bones from cardboard and cut around them on the pastry with a knife. For the best \"puff,\" keep the pastry cold as you work.\nIn a large pot, bring broth to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes, carrots, and green beans. Cover and bring to simmering; then reduce heat and cook until carrots are tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving broth, and set vegetables aside.\nMelt butter in pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, mushrooms, celery, thyme, rosemary, pepper, and salt. Saut\u00e9 until vegetables are soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add flour and cook, stirring, until light golden, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until blended, then add reserved broth and whisk until no lumps remain. Cook, whisking, until simmering, 10 to 12 minutes.\nRemove sauce from heat and stir in reserved vegetables and the chicken. Pour into a shallow baking dish about 9 by 13 in. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 375\u00b0. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 pastry sheet into a rectangle 1 in. longer and wider than baking dish. With a small knife, score a 1/2-in. border on all sides of pastry without cutting through it. Slide pastry onto a baking sheet and chill. Re-flour work surface and roll second pastry sheet to a 10- by 12-in. rectangle. Cut out 3 skulls, using a 5- by 3 1/2-in. skull-shaped cookie cutter.* Cut 4 each of large and medium bones, using 4- by 1 1/2-in. and 3 1/2- by 1 1/2-in. bone-shaped cookie cutters. Using a knife tip, score faces in skulls without cutting through pastry. Transfer skulls and bones to a baking sheet and chill until cold.\nSet chilled pastry rectangle onto cool chicken mixture, gently pushing it along score lines into edges of dish. Brush with egg. Arrange large bones on pastry and brush with egg; then arrange skulls and medium bones on top, overlapping a bit if needed, and brush with egg.\nBake until pastry is well browned, about 40 minutes; if filling starts to bubble over, put a baking sheet on lower rack under pot pie.\n*We used a skull cookie cutter and dog-bone cookie cutter set from CopperGifts.com.\nMake ahead: Through step 4, up to 1 day, filling and pastry chilled separately airtight. To continue with step 5, bring filling to room temperature, 2 hours.\nCan you suggest some alternative ingredients that can be used in the filling for this recipe, and how would they affect the overall taste and texture of the dish?",

    "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you summarize the key events and quotes from the recent feud between President Trump and Steve Bannon in relation to Michael Wolff's new book?\n\nPassage: President Trump on Thursday night slammed the author of an explosive new book chronicling the administration and featuring quotes from his former top aide Steve Bannon torching Trump's inner circle and family.\nThe comments came hours after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during a briefing Thursday that Breitbart, the far-right-leaning website that Bannon returned to running after leaving the Trump administration, should consider cutting ties with him.\n\"I certainly think that it's something they should look at and consider,\" she said. On Wednesday, Trump said Bannon had \"lost his mind\" in response to his comments in the book.\nThe president then personally aired his grievances on Twitter, lashing out at Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve\" while also denying that the White House provided any access to Michael Wolff as the author and media critic wrote Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which is set to be released on Friday.\n\"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\" Trump tweeted.\nBreitbart News Network LLC board members are reportedly considering the White House's directives to oust Bannon. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the exchanges, reported that some on the board were supportive of removing Bannon as chairman.\nAnd Bannon's financial backers, billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, distanced themselves from him.\n\"I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,\" Rebekah Mercer said in a statement. \"My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.\"\nIn Wolff's book, Bannon is quoted extensively taking shots at Trump\u2019s inner circle and family, including Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner.\nThe excerpts have caused such a stir that the publisher is releasing the book on Friday, four days ahead of schedule. This came just hours after Trump's attorneys sent a cease and desist letter demanding that the title be held back, arguing Bannon allegedly violated the terms of a nondisclosure agreement signed during his time at the White House.\nAmong the many explosive details in the book, Bannon is quoted as calling the Trump Tower meeting that Trump Jr., Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\"\nSince May 2017, the Russia investigation has led to the indictments of four people, including Manafort, who pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\nAt Breitbart News, the Fire and Fury excerpts, first published by the Guardian, were covered prominently without any denials or comments from Bannon himself.\nThe rebuke from the White House on Wednesday was swift.\n\"This book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Participating in a book that can only be described as trashy tabloid fiction exposes their sad desperate attempts at relevancy.\"\nOn his Sirius XM radio show later that night, Bannon had a softer tone, calling Trump \"a great man\" when responding to a caller\u2019s question about the apparent strain between the two men.\nTrump reportedly sent Bannon a cease-and-desist letter about the \"disparaging\" comments, ABC News reported. There was talk that Bannon was considering a defamation suit against Trump, but a source close to Bannon told BuzzFeed News that was not true.\nBut according to emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, Bannon privately expressed ambivalence about Trump as a presidential candidate before taking over his campaign, calling him a \"narcissist.\"\nThe tension between Trump and Bannon has been escalating since August, when Bannon left amid a tumultuous time at the White House. Since then, he has used his pulpit as head of Breitbart to target those as insufficiently conservative to be in the Trump administration, at times taking aim at the president himself.",

    "Can you tell me more about the best spots to catch panfish and what kind of bait to use? Answer according to: Lake Mohave is not producing much in the way of our stripped bass. There is some largemouth and smallmouth bass action. The coves around the dam and near the power lines are producing some largemouth bass while the shelves are having some smallies going after mostly plastics the dark hula tails and the pumpkin color are working well. The panfish bite is doing well but not of much size. However going down river below the Davis Dam along the Colorado river near and below the gorge you will find some great panfish activity. Pan fish, or also called bluegill, redear and sunfish in our neck of the woods, so to say. Our anglers Joel Pyne (black shirt) and Steve Jansen are showing about 25 they landed from their boat. These fish are best found in the plant life areas along the shorelines. A little closer to home and back up river along the casino row you can find some striper action. Ernie and son Kayden Calma were able to bring in these stripers, with the larger one at 2.84 pounds and 201/2 inches and one of the other larger ones at 1.90 pounds and 17 and 1/4 inches. This father and son team were using lures. They were having best luck with Savage Gear hard baits in a white swim pattern. I have been hearing that the striper bite is doing well just below community park and above the big bend area. Rotary Park is a go to spot for you trout anglers. We are getting more rainbow trout here the first part of October. With that being said we hope to see you soon and remember the limit of trout is 5 below the Davis Dam. These trout are being brought to us from the Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery; this is a federal hatchery and they are up and running and it looks like its going to be a great trout season.

    "Russian officials have expressed their sharp criticism towards the U.S. plans for the so-called \"Prompt Global Strike\" initiative. Are they justified?\nWhat does this \"Prompt Global Strike\" represent, how can it interfere with the Russian plans and how can it be opposed?\nThe U.S. military adopted the concept of the Prompt Global Strike (PGS) during the 2000s. The basis of the idea is the ability to make a non-nuclear attack anywhere in the world within an hour after a decision is made to strike.\nHow can we solve this problem? The first components of PGS, the most realistic in its execution, are conventional intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with high-precision, non-nuclear warheads.\nThe second component of PGS facilities can be strategic cruise missiles with hypersonic speeds. The third component of PGS is kinetic weapons, or \u201cwands of the Lord,\u201d which is the ironic nickname for this weapon, widely described in fiction but still not implemented in practice.\nThe United States is not making the PGS targets a secret; they have been described in Pentagon statements. But who are the PGS facilities created for? First, they are mobile and stationary ballistic missile launchers, command centers and other nuclear facilities.\nSecondly, they are \"facilities isolating military operations\u201d \u2013 launchers of tactical missiles as well as antiaircraft missiles, obstructing the standard air-ground or air-sea operations.\nThirdly, it is the terrorist infrastructure \u2013 in this case the use of PGS is not any different from the strikes made from unmanned aircrafts.\nChina, North Korea and Iran are named as the owners of this infrastructure, and in the third paragraph it says that it is \"international terrorism.\"\nAt the same time, Russia has many facilities isolating military operations, as well as mobile missile launchers, and therefore it cannot be excluded from the list of possible PGS targets.\nIt is clear that a similar attack is fraught with risks of nuclear escalation and full-scale retaliation against the United States. However, on the basis of this sole thesis, it is impossible to conclude that PGS does not threaten Russia.\nThe biggest part of PGS is, of course, the ballistic missiles equipped with precision nonnuclear warheads. The idea was one of the first ones, and it was also one of the last ones to become the subject of skepticism.\nIn fact, the non-nuclear ICBMs have a number of drawbacks. Mainly because all the systems of missile warning and missile defense information tools are detected as this type of objects (as well as warheads after their division).\nAnd if this does not matter during operations conducted as PGS against a third world country, as soon as it comes to a potential enemy such as Russia or even China, things get much worse.\nIt does not say on the intercontinental missile which equipment it has, and, strictly speaking, during a the mass start of such missiles any country\u2019s government has all the capabilities of organizing a retaliatory strike, i.e. of launching their missiles (already with the nuclear equipment), without waiting for the arrival of unexpected guests.\nFrom the point of view of the principles of nuclear strategy and international security in general, this is a very bad option, hence the reaction of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\"If we are talking about existing ballistic carriers with conventional equipment, it is clearly the path to the escalation of the conflict with the hardest, in fact, apocalyptic consequences,\" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.\nThat is why the main focus of development of PGS facilities was redirected to the hypersonic aircraft. This topic is more complex in terms of its engineering and physical design and implementation process, however, the resulting facilities are more flexible, versatile and more promising.\nIt is necessary to understand the capabilities of modern air defense systems. The Top Russian ADMS \u2013 S-300PMU-2 Favorit and S-400, are capable of striking targets moving at speeds of up to 2,800 and up to 4,500 meter per second, respectively.\nThis is on a hypersonic level, however, the same prototype of Falcon HTV-2 attains a speed of up to 7,800 meter per second, which is comparable with speeds of military intercontinental missiles at the terminal stage of their trajectory.\nAs for the facilities of the kinetic destruction, the question of their deployment and a creation of defense facilities against them cannot be solved tomorrow. In any case, the orbiting of such systems will trigger a new arms race, coupled with the creation of space-based weapons, and possibly a return to the orbital system of nuclear bombing, the first samples of which were tested in the late \u201860s and subsequently prohibited by the 1979 SALT 2 Treaty.\nIn the conditions of reducing the threat of global nuclear war since 1991 and, at the same time, a distinct lowering of the threshold for using tactical nuclear weapons, the full deployment of PGS can significantly complicate the maintenance of strategic stability. This explains the sharp reaction of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\nHow does the development of hypersonic aircraft impact the implementation of PGS, and what are some of the challenges in defending against such systems?",

    "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are the Republicans considering in regards to Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi probe?\n\nPassage: Issa's new effort on Benghazi probe: a subpoena for Hillary Clinton?\nRepublicans have accused Mullen and Pickering of protecting [former Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton in their report by not citing her for any breaches of leadership. By pushing back at their report \u2014 both at the methods and the content \u2014 Republicans hope to erode one of the biggest defenses of Clinton.\nDemocrats tell Politico that the testimony of Pickering and Mullen will vindicate the ARB, but that seems unlikely. Pickering himself admitted that he only interviewed lower-level State officials because he had decided beforehand where the blame should be fixed, telling Bob Schieffer in May, \u201cWe knew where the responsibility rested.\u201d The ARB ignored Undersecretary Patrick Kennedy, who made decisions on consulate security, but who also was a key aide to the Clintons during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and during all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure at State.\nRepublicans are mulling whether to demand former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s return to Capitol Hill to face more tough questions about her agency\u2019s failure to protect diplomats and security staff in Benghazi, Libya a year ago.\nAn aide to a high-ranking GOP member of the House Oversight and Government Affairs committee told MailOnline that the committee\u2019s chairman, California Rep. Darrell Issa, \u2018is dead serious\u2019 about raking the likely 2016 presidential candidate over the coals in the future.\nIssa told the Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning that his committee won\u2019t hesitate to bring back any of the senior-level witnesses who have already testified about the September 11, 2012 terror attack on American diplomatic facilities in the eastern Libya port city.\nAnd that includes Hillary Clinton.\nIssa sounds less inclined to issue a subpoena than to force Hillary back to the panel on her own volition. Undermining the ARB report will be a first step, and I\u2019d expect that Issa has confidence in his ability to do that. Otherwise, he\u2019d skip calling Pickering and Mullen and just focus on the CIA survivors, who will eventually get subpoenaed to testify. With the previous testimony from State Department whistleblowers in hand, Issa will next aim at Kennedy \u2014 and will be bolstered in that effort by an independent review that named Kennedy as a responsible party, unlike the ARB, a discrepancy that Issa will no doubt highlight.\nIf they build the case all the way to Kennedy, that will put a lot of public pressure on Hillary to make an appearance at the Oversight hearings, which takes the onus off of Republicans to issue a subpoena. At that point, Issa will issue a public invitation to Hillary to address the issues that have arisen from a multitude of sources about the incompetence and deceit at State during her tenure. If she refuses to appear, that\u2019s not going to look good, regardless of whether she wants to run for office later or not. It won\u2019t prevent Oversight from making a damning case about her leadership at State, either.",
    "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposal for old city buildings, and how will it benefit the city's environment?\n\nPassage: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently made waves when he proposed energy efficiency improvements for old city buildings spewing pollutants. Some cities already require similar upgrades when properties are sold, but de Blasio\u2019s proposal is unique: it applies to all buildings, for sale or not.\nThis new initiative, brought forth in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, should establish the city as a leader in environmental efforts.\nThe new proposal underscores that the time is right for energy retrofits, if not to save the planet then at least to save money for property owners and add value upon sale.\nWhen it comes to the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the numbers add up. In New York, the 14,500 buildings \u2014 out of a total of about 1 million citywide \u2014 targeted by de Blasio\u2019s proposal blast out a full 24 percent of the Big Apple\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\nEven if reducing greenhouse gases is not a priority for property owners, the bottom line benefits of an energy retrofit can be substantial, especially for older buildings.\nSuch is the case for New York\u2019s 87-year-old Empire State Building, which underwent a holistic energy efficiency upgrade in 2011 and has saved millions annually since. The retrofit involved all 6,514 windows of the 102-story building.\nRelatively speaking, homeowners can also realize significant savings from retrofits, along with the added bonus of improvements in comfort level and indoor air quality.\nRetrofits can also add resale value. Attic insulation, for example, \u201cmore than paid for itself\u201d in a majority of the markets surveyed by Remodeling Magazine last year.\n\u201dYou can put bells and whistles in a poorly performing building and what you have is a poorly performing building with bells and whistles,\u201d he cautioned.\nNext comes upgrading HVAC equipment and major appliances. Jones advises homeowners to be careful not to overlook a water heater upgrade. Water heaters are the number one item people take for granted, he said. Usually when they give out, people are desperate to replace them, but they are the second or third largest energy user in the house, he explained.\nDespite the clear long-term savings, motivating property owners to invest money up front in energy retrofits is still a challenge.\nFortunately, new emerging financing options are making it easy for commercial builders to go the environmentally-friendly route.\nFor example, Energy Savings Performance Contracts provide for retrofits with no costs up front. The contractor receives payment based on the value of the energy saved.\nNew incentives for homeowners are also beginning to emerge, some of which are tied to upgrade mandates such as de Blasio\u2019s proposal, which provides low interest, long-term financing among other incentives.\nEnergy efficient mortgages are another new instrument that eliminates the initial economic sting from a homeowner\u2019s decision to invest in a retrofit.\nAs Jones says, the internet is providing property sellers and buyers new tools for researching retrofit costs and comparing home values, and property owners stand to make big bottom line gains by using it.\nTina Casey has been writing about sustainability, alternative energy and energy efficiency since 2009.
