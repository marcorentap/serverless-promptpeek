    "Can you summarize the different types of thalassemia and how they affect the body?: Thalassemia is a blood disorder that causes mild or severe anemia (Antonio, 1993). This happens when people do not have enough hemoglobin and is caused by the inheritance of a defective gene (Nathan, 1998). Thalassemia is passed on from a parent to children through their genes (Simon, 1999). The name thalassemia comes from the Greek word \"thalassa\" meaning \"the sea\" because the condition was first described in populations living near the Mediterranean Sea (Nathan, 1998). However, the disease is also prevalent in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and pacific descent (Simon, 1999). Moreover, thalassemia causes an immense disruption in the hemoglobin synthesis (Nathan, 1998). Although, there are two different types of thalassemia, alpha, and beta thalassemia they both affect the body.\nAlpha-thalassemia occurs most commonly in people from Southeast Asia and China (Ghosh, 1994). Its is caused when the hemoglobin does not produce enough alpha protein (Ghosh, 1994). The most severe form of alpha thalassemia causes (stillbirth, and death of fetus before delivery) (Ghosh, 1994).\nWhereas, beta thalassemia, is caused by a mutation in the beta globin chain (Nathan, 1998). Genes from both parents must be inherited to acquire the major form of this disease (Simon, 1999). In beta thalassemia major children are normal at birth, but develop anemia during the first year of life (Simon, 1999). The alpha and beta thalassemia's are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Therefore, the symptoms of thalassemia, which are paleness, tiredness, dark urine, and spleen enlargement all, depend on the type and severity of the disease ( Simon, 1999).\nWriteWork contributors. \"Thalassemia\" WriteWork.com.
