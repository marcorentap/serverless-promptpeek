    "Southern Cone Travel: Ice, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nIce, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nAlmost everyone who visits Patagonia looks forward to seeing the great glaciers of Chile\u2019s Fuegian fjords or the massive southern icefields that culminate in Argentina\u2019s Moreno Glacier (pictured below). There are other cool treats that await visitors, though - on their palates, in the form of ice cream (or gelato, if you prefer). Some of it is found in Patagonia itself, but it\u2019s also popular in gateway cities like Buenos Aires.\nMost but not all of those treats are from Argentina, stemming from the Italian tradition that has spread throughout the country. I\u2019d like to recommend a sample of ice creameries and flavors, though I\u2019ll acknowledge a personal prejudice at the beginning: I do not share the adoration for dulce de leche, made from caramelized milk (which Chileans call manjar) that all Argentines and many Chileans drool over. Personally, I find it sickly sweet and, if you choose to try it, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I will not mention it further.\nFor more than three decades, my personal favorite has been Cadore (pictured above) in the Congreso district of downtown Buenos Aires (one of the gateway cities for many a Patagonia itinerary). In the same family since it opened in the 1950s. it\u2019s won awards in Italy itself. The roster of flavors may be less diverse than some more contemporary helader\u00edas, but the quality is extraordinary. My recommendations: chocolate amargo (bittersweet chocolate) and mousse de lim\u00f3n (lemon mousse) are an unbeatable combination.\nIn northern Argentine Patagonia, at the base of the Andes, the town of El Bols\u00f3n is the cradle of Helados Jauja (pictured above), which produces many standard flavors but specializes in local fruit flavors, among them the wild calafate berry (according to legend, whoever eats the berry will come back to Patagonia for more). In recent years, this one-of-a-kind ice creamery has opened branches in Buenos Aires and elsewhere, but still produces everything at its home base. My recommendation: calafate con leche de oveja (calafate berries with sheep\u2019s milk) and mate cocido con tres de az\u00facar (Argentines\u2019 favorite infusion, roughly comparable to green tea, is also popular in parts of Chile).\nMeanwhile, in the Chilean ferry port of Puerto Natales \u2013 the gateway to Torres del Paine \u2013 Mesita Grande (pictured above) is a pizzeria that takes its name from the single long table that its diners necessarily share. That said, it prepares its own ice cream and, when I offhandedly mentioned Jauja\u2019s calafate flavor, Mesita\u2019s Argentine manager went out of her way to track down berries and sheep\u2019s milk to try to duplicate it. A couple days later, she phoned me to come try it, and the result was a promising experiment that\u2019s not on the regular menu. Still, in its absence, here are my recommendations: chocolate and ruibarbo (rhubarb). There\u2019s also a branch in Punta Arenas, the gateway to the glacial fjords of Tierra del Fuego (pictured below). What is Helados Jauja specializing in and what are some recommended flavors to try at this ice creamery in El Bols\u00f3n?",

    "What are the potential obstacles to adopting the Phonebloks concept, including economic and aesthetic factors? Answer according to: We all know that the cycle of electronics consumerism is broken. Because it's an endless money drain for consumers to keep their gadgets current. Because the never ending desire to show off new features leads to bloat and complexity of design. And because all our outdated, abandoned gadgets have to go somewhere. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we Americans threw away 310 million electronic gadgets in 2010 alone. That's about 1.8 million tons of toxic, nonbiodegradable waste in our landfills.\nAt least somebody's expressing concern about this problem\u2014nearly 15 million somebodies, actually. That's how many people have watched a viral YouTube video called Phonebloks, which touts a new phone concept by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens.\nHakkens wants the people of Earth to rise up and demand a new kind of cell phone, in which the various components\u2014camera, processor, GPS, screen\u2014snap together like Legos.\nThis system, he says, would let you build exactly the phone you want. If you keep your files online, you could remove the storage module and replace it with a bigger battery. If you are older, you could unplug the camera and replace it with a bigger speaker.\nAbove all, though, he suggests that the Phonebloks concept would dramatically cut down on e-waste. You wouldn't throw away a phone every other year; instead you'd own just one phone that's built\u2014and rebuilt\u2014to last. If one component broke or became obsolete, you'd just unplug it and replace it with a new one.\nClearly, this concept is consumer catnip. It offers the promise of staying current\u2014without the guilt. And of saving us money and of making it easy for anyone to build a customized phone.\nThere's only one hitch: Phonebloks will never happen.\nThe first problem: physics. Today's smartphone is a miracle of miniaturization. To keep the size small, the speed up and the battery life long, the components are packed in as closely as possible. In Apple's iPhone, for example, the memory, the processor and the graphics circuitry are all built into a single chip. A Phonebloks phone would introduce relatively gigantic distances between these elements, which would kill the battery life, speed and size.\nWhich brings us to the second problem: bulk. Steve Jobs refused to put a removable battery on the iPhone for this reason. A removable battery has to be enclosed in rigid walls so that you, the human, can handle it safely. If every component of your phone were a self-contained, sealed box like that battery, you'd have one very boxy, very bulky, very heavy phone.\nThe third problem: given the limited real estate, today's smartphone engineers sweat over component placement. Where should the antennas go for the best reception? Where does the speaker go for best audio? With free placement of any block on a Phonebloks phone, you would lose enormous advantages of quality, convenience and speed.\nThe fourth problem: economics. The Verizons and AT&Ts of the world love that we throw away our phones every other year; indeed, locking us into new two-year contracts is their business model. Why would they support any movement that would disrupt their herd of cash cows?\nAnd finally: aesthetics. Who would buy the big, boxy, gray, sharp-cornered prototype illustrated in the video?\nYou want to love the Phonebloks concept. You'd love to have more control, greater savings and less guilt. Unfortunately, you'd pay quite a penalty: your phone would be big, heavy, slow, hot, fragile and ugly. Some analysts have even asserted that we would wind up with more electronic waste, a result of consumers discarding more modules more frequently.\nThere is some good news on the discarded-phone front: from all indications, the smartphone is maturing. The improvements in each year's new models are getting less dramatic. These days it's primarily the software that distinguishes your iPhone from your Samsung\u2014and software leaves nothing in landfills.\nEven so, e-waste and obsolescence remain distressing problems. No, Phonebloks is not the solution. But at least it has drawn attention to our current system\u2014and just how broken it is.\nDavid Pogue is the personal-technology columnist for the New York Times and an Emmy Award-winning correspondent for CBS News.",
