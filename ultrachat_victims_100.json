    "What many companies do when planning their global marketing strategies is to organize the world\u2019s countries into three categories.\nEmerging Markets \u2013 Markets regarded as having the most potential for growth (e.g. huge countries such as China and India) and targeted for long-term investment.\nRest of the World (ROW) Markets \u2013 Markets that are often not included in a global marketing strategy because a company does not have sufficient time or resources to pay them any attention.\nA typical company involved in global marketing is likely to have four or five core markets and maybe six to twelve emerging markets.\nIs it Wise to Ignore the ROW?\nCollectively the ROW consists of a huge market of over a billion people. Of course the ROW includes a lot of small countries, but even a country with only five to six million people (e.g. Denmark and Ireland) could be very profitable for the right product. Click here for a list of countries in order of population.\nWhich Languages Does the \u201cRest of the World\u201d Speak?\nThe Web Globalization Report Card, which tracks the websites of 150 global companies, reports a steadily increasing number of languages supported by global content. As of 2018, the average number of languages supported by all 150 global websites is now thirty-two.\nThe success of global marketing can only be achieved through the use of local languages. If the growth in the number of languages is imagined as a curve, this curve begins quite steeply as companies load up on the core European and Asian languages. After a company reaches the level of twenty languages, the curve starts to taper off. The number of languages supported by a few companies, such as Facebook, Visa, and Dyson has shot up in sudden spikes. However, most companies are only in the early stages of this growth curve.\nIt would be a herculean task to utilize the more than 6,000 languages spoken worldwide, so a global marketing company has to narrow down its language choices to the languages spoken by its core target audiences. The following is a list of ten languages that are shared by leading global websites.\nEnglish \u2013 English is the language of globalization and is spoken by over 75% of the world\u2019s population.\nChinese (Simplified) \u2013 If people in Chinese speaking markets continue to expand their internet usage, Chinese might one day supplant English as the most widely used internet language.\nArabic \u2013 The Arabic language is spoken by 295 million speakers worldwide, and is the official language of 28 different countries. A report from the British Council ranks Arabic as the second most important language of the future.\nSpanish \u2013 There are a number of important Spanish speaking countries, not to mention that the Hispanic population in the US will likely double by 2050.\nGerman \u2013 The German language is the fourth most spoken language in the world with nearly 210 million speakers worldwide.\nPortuguese \u2013 Second behind Spanish in Latin America. Portuguese is spoken by 215 million people in Portugal, Brazil, and some parts of Africa.\nFrench \u2013 French is the official language of over 29 countries throughout the world including several of the fastest growing African economies.\nJapanese \u2013 Japanese has 130 million native speakers and a similar number of non-native speakers spread out over the world.\nRussian \u2013 There are 160 million native speakers in Russia and throughout central and Eastern Europe.\nHindi \u2013 Although India is home to 126 million English speakers, around 85% of the population doesn\u2019t speak English well or at all. India represents an enormous growing market.\nIf you are hoping to increase your global marketing reach, it\u2019s essential to expand the number of languages your website or app supports. All countries, including the \u201crest of the world,\u201d are within your reach. Once you have decided on your target markets, Localize will help you translate your content into the local languages. Talk to us for more information.\nCan you provide a list of the top ten languages that global marketing companies should focus on, according to the leading global websites?",

    "Can you summarize the different types of thalassemia and how they affect the body?: Thalassemia is a blood disorder that causes mild or severe anemia (Antonio, 1993). This happens when people do not have enough hemoglobin and is caused by the inheritance of a defective gene (Nathan, 1998). Thalassemia is passed on from a parent to children through their genes (Simon, 1999). The name thalassemia comes from the Greek word \"thalassa\" meaning \"the sea\" because the condition was first described in populations living near the Mediterranean Sea (Nathan, 1998). However, the disease is also prevalent in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and pacific descent (Simon, 1999). Moreover, thalassemia causes an immense disruption in the hemoglobin synthesis (Nathan, 1998). Although, there are two different types of thalassemia, alpha, and beta thalassemia they both affect the body.\nAlpha-thalassemia occurs most commonly in people from Southeast Asia and China (Ghosh, 1994). Its is caused when the hemoglobin does not produce enough alpha protein (Ghosh, 1994). The most severe form of alpha thalassemia causes (stillbirth, and death of fetus before delivery) (Ghosh, 1994).\nWhereas, beta thalassemia, is caused by a mutation in the beta globin chain (Nathan, 1998). Genes from both parents must be inherited to acquire the major form of this disease (Simon, 1999). In beta thalassemia major children are normal at birth, but develop anemia during the first year of life (Simon, 1999). The alpha and beta thalassemia's are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Therefore, the symptoms of thalassemia, which are paleness, tiredness, dark urine, and spleen enlargement all, depend on the type and severity of the disease ( Simon, 1999).\nWriteWork contributors. \"Thalassemia\" WriteWork.com.

    "Southern Cone Travel: Ice, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nIce, or Ice Cream? Or Both?\nAlmost everyone who visits Patagonia looks forward to seeing the great glaciers of Chile\u2019s Fuegian fjords or the massive southern icefields that culminate in Argentina\u2019s Moreno Glacier (pictured below). There are other cool treats that await visitors, though - on their palates, in the form of ice cream (or gelato, if you prefer). Some of it is found in Patagonia itself, but it\u2019s also popular in gateway cities like Buenos Aires.\nMost but not all of those treats are from Argentina, stemming from the Italian tradition that has spread throughout the country. I\u2019d like to recommend a sample of ice creameries and flavors, though I\u2019ll acknowledge a personal prejudice at the beginning: I do not share the adoration for dulce de leche, made from caramelized milk (which Chileans call manjar) that all Argentines and many Chileans drool over. Personally, I find it sickly sweet and, if you choose to try it, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I will not mention it further.\nFor more than three decades, my personal favorite has been Cadore (pictured above) in the Congreso district of downtown Buenos Aires (one of the gateway cities for many a Patagonia itinerary). In the same family since it opened in the 1950s. it\u2019s won awards in Italy itself. The roster of flavors may be less diverse than some more contemporary helader\u00edas, but the quality is extraordinary. My recommendations: chocolate amargo (bittersweet chocolate) and mousse de lim\u00f3n (lemon mousse) are an unbeatable combination.\nIn northern Argentine Patagonia, at the base of the Andes, the town of El Bols\u00f3n is the cradle of Helados Jauja (pictured above), which produces many standard flavors but specializes in local fruit flavors, among them the wild calafate berry (according to legend, whoever eats the berry will come back to Patagonia for more). In recent years, this one-of-a-kind ice creamery has opened branches in Buenos Aires and elsewhere, but still produces everything at its home base. My recommendation: calafate con leche de oveja (calafate berries with sheep\u2019s milk) and mate cocido con tres de az\u00facar (Argentines\u2019 favorite infusion, roughly comparable to green tea, is also popular in parts of Chile).\nMeanwhile, in the Chilean ferry port of Puerto Natales \u2013 the gateway to Torres del Paine \u2013 Mesita Grande (pictured above) is a pizzeria that takes its name from the single long table that its diners necessarily share. That said, it prepares its own ice cream and, when I offhandedly mentioned Jauja\u2019s calafate flavor, Mesita\u2019s Argentine manager went out of her way to track down berries and sheep\u2019s milk to try to duplicate it. A couple days later, she phoned me to come try it, and the result was a promising experiment that\u2019s not on the regular menu. Still, in its absence, here are my recommendations: chocolate and ruibarbo (rhubarb). There\u2019s also a branch in Punta Arenas, the gateway to the glacial fjords of Tierra del Fuego (pictured below). What is Helados Jauja specializing in and what are some recommended flavors to try at this ice creamery in El Bols\u00f3n?",

    "What are the potential obstacles to adopting the Phonebloks concept, including economic and aesthetic factors? Answer according to: We all know that the cycle of electronics consumerism is broken. Because it's an endless money drain for consumers to keep their gadgets current. Because the never ending desire to show off new features leads to bloat and complexity of design. And because all our outdated, abandoned gadgets have to go somewhere. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we Americans threw away 310 million electronic gadgets in 2010 alone. That's about 1.8 million tons of toxic, nonbiodegradable waste in our landfills.\nAt least somebody's expressing concern about this problem\u2014nearly 15 million somebodies, actually. That's how many people have watched a viral YouTube video called Phonebloks, which touts a new phone concept by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens.\nHakkens wants the people of Earth to rise up and demand a new kind of cell phone, in which the various components\u2014camera, processor, GPS, screen\u2014snap together like Legos.\nThis system, he says, would let you build exactly the phone you want. If you keep your files online, you could remove the storage module and replace it with a bigger battery. If you are older, you could unplug the camera and replace it with a bigger speaker.\nAbove all, though, he suggests that the Phonebloks concept would dramatically cut down on e-waste. You wouldn't throw away a phone every other year; instead you'd own just one phone that's built\u2014and rebuilt\u2014to last. If one component broke or became obsolete, you'd just unplug it and replace it with a new one.\nClearly, this concept is consumer catnip. It offers the promise of staying current\u2014without the guilt. And of saving us money and of making it easy for anyone to build a customized phone.\nThere's only one hitch: Phonebloks will never happen.\nThe first problem: physics. Today's smartphone is a miracle of miniaturization. To keep the size small, the speed up and the battery life long, the components are packed in as closely as possible. In Apple's iPhone, for example, the memory, the processor and the graphics circuitry are all built into a single chip. A Phonebloks phone would introduce relatively gigantic distances between these elements, which would kill the battery life, speed and size.\nWhich brings us to the second problem: bulk. Steve Jobs refused to put a removable battery on the iPhone for this reason. A removable battery has to be enclosed in rigid walls so that you, the human, can handle it safely. If every component of your phone were a self-contained, sealed box like that battery, you'd have one very boxy, very bulky, very heavy phone.\nThe third problem: given the limited real estate, today's smartphone engineers sweat over component placement. Where should the antennas go for the best reception? Where does the speaker go for best audio? With free placement of any block on a Phonebloks phone, you would lose enormous advantages of quality, convenience and speed.\nThe fourth problem: economics. The Verizons and AT&Ts of the world love that we throw away our phones every other year; indeed, locking us into new two-year contracts is their business model. Why would they support any movement that would disrupt their herd of cash cows?\nAnd finally: aesthetics. Who would buy the big, boxy, gray, sharp-cornered prototype illustrated in the video?\nYou want to love the Phonebloks concept. You'd love to have more control, greater savings and less guilt. Unfortunately, you'd pay quite a penalty: your phone would be big, heavy, slow, hot, fragile and ugly. Some analysts have even asserted that we would wind up with more electronic waste, a result of consumers discarding more modules more frequently.\nThere is some good news on the discarded-phone front: from all indications, the smartphone is maturing. The improvements in each year's new models are getting less dramatic. These days it's primarily the software that distinguishes your iPhone from your Samsung\u2014and software leaves nothing in landfills.\nEven so, e-waste and obsolescence remain distressing problems. No, Phonebloks is not the solution. But at least it has drawn attention to our current system\u2014and just how broken it is.\nDavid Pogue is the personal-technology columnist for the New York Times and an Emmy Award-winning correspondent for CBS News.",

Or maybe it was just a lower-level staffer on his account who thought it was cool. But regardless, it shows that there\u2019s at least some purchase for this kind of heroic-fiction narrative in the White House, shaping how they want the public to think of them and quite possibly how the president thinks about himself.\nOh come on! Try a bit harder. This has nothing to do with what the cast of Game of Thrones thinks.\nIn a statement released by the White House later Friday, Trump said: \u201cOn Monday, November 5, the termination of United States participation in the Iran nuclear deal will be complete. The last set of sanctions lifted under the terrible nuclear deal will come back into force, including powerful sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors, and sanctions targeting transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and sanctioned Iranian banks.\nI have a feeling that some executive finally figured out the President Trump, personally and totally for free, gave them the finest advertising any TV show has ever received!

But they don\u2019t use the phrase in quite the same manner as Trump did.\nTrump\u2019s administration has used movie marketing tactics in its messaging, and even used an blockbuster-style trailer in Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim Jong Un. Trump said he played it for the North Korean leader.\nWell, close but no cigar but at least they\u2019re awake enough to realize we\u2019ve seen something like this before.\nAll right . . . I guess it\u2019s my job to point out what should be obvious to everyone. Donald Trump is using the \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d strategy to see if he can get Iran to communicate with him. He\u2019s asking them to meme back or tweet something that he can use to start a dialog. He\u2019s put something so outrageous and over the top out there that the leadership of Iran has certainly seen it and probably has analysts working overtime trying to figure out what it means.\nNote to Iran: It just means he\u2019d like to engage with you and humor is always a good way to start a conversation.\nHe\u2019s right here \u2014 listening.

Mr. Winton said that is only part of the solution \u2013 the method of transporting goods through the tunnel is its complement.\n\"My concern is that once the cargo containers go over the river, they\u2019re going to get half a mile down the road and in 15 or 20 years, they\u2019re not going to go anywhere,\" he said, \"because the cargo all has to go to west Miami-Dade because 836 is a mess and it\u2019s going to be worse.\"\nViability of transporting freight by rail, he said, was discussed Oct. 17 at the port.\n\"There are significant forces opposed to this analysis, and they\u2019re principally coming from the port,\" Mr. Winton said. \"They don\u2019t want this analysis done.
